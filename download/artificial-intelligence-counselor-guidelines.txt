Note to Counselor
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Merit Badge
The Artificial Intelligence merit badge introduces Scouts to the world of AI. As they work on the
requirements for the AI merit badge, Scouts will explore the fundamental concepts of AI,
different types of AI, and how it is used in everyday life.
A critical part of the badge will be a discussion of the ethical implications of AI. Topics include
data privacy, the potential for bias in AI systems, and the impact of AI on jobs and society. The
idea is to encourage Scouts to think critically about the technology’s role in the world and their
responsibilities as digital citizens.
Scouts will also be asked to investigate career opportunities in AI and related fields. This will
involve researching the education, training, and skills required for such professions.
There is no pamphlet for this merit badge, by design. The badge works with the Scoutly AI
chatbot, giving Scouts real experience with AI tools. More information on Scoutly here.
The digital resources do not replace the need for a real-life, human merit badge
counselor. Encourage Scouts to interact with the Scoutly chatbot as a part of their learning
journey, but remind them that Scoutly does not replace your role in evaluating understanding
and completion. Reinforce the importance of discussing what they’ve learned–not just
completing tasks. Ask open-ended questions to assess comprehension and reflection. Be
flexible with examples. Scouts may draw from personal experiences, school, hobbies, or
community observations to fulfill requirements.
How does Scoutly work?
Scoutly is an AI tool or digital helper trained only on official Scouting America documents.
Anyone who’s ever searched the internet for information knows there’s a risk of getting outdated
or even outright false information. Scoutly has access to all of the organization’s data on merit
badges, meaning it can provide detailed guidance on the requirements and other information in
the merit badge pamphlets. As an AI tool, it is always learning. More official Scouting America
publications are added to its knowledge base each week. Scoutly does best when it is asked
clear questions. As currently configured, each question is new; it does not remember the
previous questions or learn a skill. It cannot provide images.


How to ask Scoutly questions
To ask Scoutly a question about a requirement, it’s important to be specific. If you ask the same
question a couple times in a row, don’t be surprised that the answer will change. The chatbot is
a computer program that generates responses probabilistically, meaning it does not pick the
single “correct” next word, but one of several likely options. There can be random variations with
the same prompt which can lead to different phrasing, structure, or even examples. Some
questions may have more than one good answer, so it picks one of several options. Check all
answers for correctness.
A Scout can try various questions to see how specific the question needs to be. It may be
helpful to include the name of the merit badge in the question. Sometimes using a fresh web
browser helps.
Try these questions, all about knots:
● What is a knot?
● How are knots used in Scouting?
● How do I tie a knot?
● How do I tie a square knot?
● What is a good knot to lash two poles together?
● How do I teach someone a square knot?
● Tell me an interesting fact about knots.
● What merit badge uses knots?
