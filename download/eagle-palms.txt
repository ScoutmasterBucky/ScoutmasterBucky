EAGLE PALM REQUIREMENTS*
After successfully completing an Eagle Scout board of review
and being validated as an Eagle Scout by the National Service Center,
a Scout can be recognized immediately with an Eagle Palm for each
additional five merit badges they have earned beyond the 21 merit badges required
for the rank of Eagle Scout.
After becoming an Eagle Scout and receiving the Eagle Palms you are entitled
to, you may earn additional Palms by completing the following requirements:
 LEADER
INITIAL
& DATE
1. Since earning the Eagle Scout rank or your last Eagle Palm, demonstrate
Scout spirit by living the Scout Oath and Scout Law. Tell how you have
done your duty to God and how you have lived the Scout Oath and
Scout Law in your everyday life. (See pages 11–16, 23, and 415.)
2. Continue to set a satisfactory example of accepting responsibility or
demonstrating leadership ability. (See pages 32–44.)
3. Earn five additional merit badges beyond those required for Eagle
or last Palm.** (See pages 28 and 46–49.)
You may wear only the proper combination of Palms for the number
of merit badges you earned beyond the rank of Eagle. The Bronze Palm
represents five merit badges, the Gold Palm 10, and the Silver Palm 15.
Notes: *For Venturers working on Scouts BSA requirements, replace “Scoutmaster” with “crew Advisor.” For Sea Scouts
working on Scouts BSA requirements, replace “Scoutmaster” with “Skipper.”
**Merit badges earned any time since becoming a Scout may be used to meet this requirement.
