.School and You
School and You
How do you feel about yourself as a student? How do you
see yourself in this important role? By the time you graduate
from high school, you will have spent more than 2,000 days of
your life in classrooms, accumulating more than 17,000 hours
of instruction.
That’s a lot of time and effort to put into the pursuit of
knowledge. Believe it or not, how you perceive yourself as a
student, and how your teachers and school administrators see
you, can make or break your academic experience. It might
sound too simple to be true, but having a positive attitude
toward your education is the single most important
quality you can bring to your academic career.
Why should an upbeat attitude toward school matter so
much? Think about how hard it is to do something when your
mind and heart aren’t in it. It does not
matter whether you are facing a math
problem or an opponent on the playing
field; if you are not interested in doing
it, you probably will not give your best
effort to achieve success.
Besides a positive attitude, other
attributes will also help you be a suc-
cessful learner. Being open-minded
and motivated by your own success
are critical. Developing good mental
habits, such as precision, perseverance,
a flexible mindset, willingness to take
intellectual risks, and problem solving,
will help you be successful, too. All are
critical to becoming an accomplished
learner—which isn’t always the same
as an accomplished student.


8 SCHOLARSHIP
School and You.
Working on the Scholarship merit badge provides you with
a great opportunity to become more successful in school. You
will learn how to improve your skills in the classroom, develop
good study habits, and master techniques for writing reports
and taking tests. You will learn about the value of teamwork
and how crucial it is that people appreciate each other’s
differences and work together effectively to achieve the best
possible results.
Education provides the foundation from which you can
reach your goals. No doubt about it!
A good, well-rounded education takes effort to
achieve. Yet, your school days will fly by if you
embrace learning as an exciting path of self-
discovery and adventure. The more you learn
about yourself and the world around you, the
more opportunities will be available to you.

Surgeon General
David Satcher
Dr. David Satcher, America’s first
African American male surgeon general
(1998–2002), almost died from a double
whammy of whooping cough and
pneumonia when he was 2 years old.
But the young boy who lived with
his family on a remote Alabama farm
lived through the ordeal, thanks
to an African American doctor who
journeyed to the isolated Satcher
homestead on his day off and stayed
until the toddler was out of danger.
He never forgot that experience. From
then on, Satcher became increasingly interested in medicine and
health. In 1998, President Clinton selected Satcher to serve a four-year
term as the 16th surgeon general of the United States.
As America’s doctor, he wanted to be known as the surgeon
general who listened to the American people and who responded
with effective programs. His mission was to make public health work
for everyone, particularly with regard to proper health care, preven-
tion programs, and treatment for all citizens. In particular, Dr. Satcher
investigated how infant mortality, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and cancer
affect minorities and rural and urban populations.
He graduated from Morehouse College in Atlanta in 1963 and
earned his M.D. and Ph.D. from Case Western Reserve University
in 1970. He has served as a faculty member at the UCLA School of
Medicine and Public Health. From 1993 to 1998, he was director of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and administrator of the
Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. He now serves as
director of the National Center for Primary Care at Morehouse School
of Medicine.
Not only does Dr. Satcher promote healthy lifestyles across the
country as part of his work, but he also is an avid jogger and tennis
player in his private life.





SCHOLARSHIP 11
.The Genuine Value of School
The Genuine
Value of School
The basic knowledge and skills you gain in school can
be applied toward job training and understanding other
people better, and can offer unlimited opportunities for
personal development.
The core subjects you are taught in school—reading,
mathematics, writing, science, and social studies—form the
foundation from which you will build your future. These skills
include reading and writing in all subjects, solving problems,
seeing different perspectives, and communicating it all with
thoughtful precision. All play a vital role in your ability to
contribute to society.
For example, say you dread English class because you have
to write essays. Right now, you might not make the connection
between how being able to write an essay will help you later
in life, or how that scholastic skill is used in the real world.
Writing well helps you clearly communicate your thoughts to
your readers.
When you apply to college, you may be asked to write an
essay on a specific subject. Particularly when a college receives
many applications from students with excellent grades, school
administrators lean heavily toward the best-written student
essays to determine who will be accepted. Many scholarship
applications also require essays.
The elective
classes you
choose
enhance your
understanding
of core subjects.
Art, music,
drafting, and a
host of other
electives
enhance your
overall education.
For job interviews, you might be asked to write
a business letter or a short essay to demonstrate
your ability to communicate. Learning how to write
an effective letter now can pay off later when you
look for employment. You may be asked to make a
presentation, perhaps using technology, to demon-
strate your communication skills.


12 SCHOLARSHIP
The Genuine Value of School.
Some of the math you learn might not seem useful, but
as an adult, you will use math skills every day to balance
your checkbook, estimate percentages for taxes and tips, and
when you take measurements for any kind of building, home
improvement, or hobby project.
In addition to building basic knowledge and skills, you
will learn in school how to study effectively, how to plan
and organize your schedule, how to research a topic that
interests you, and how to analyze intelligently what you read
online and in newspapers and see on television. When your
school days are behind you, you will use the skills you learned
in school to learn new things. You might not remember all the
facts you memorized for tests, but you will never forget the
skills you used to learn them.
Simply knowing information is not enough. It’s even
more important to be able to apply the information—to put
it to work in order to make the connections between differ-
ent concepts you have learned. One tool you might learn is
called mind mapping. The trick is to boil down a complex set
of information into a few sketches or pictures and/or as few
words as you can use to describe the event.


SCHOLARSHIP 13
.The Genuine Value of School
Suppose you are studying U.S. history and you need to
remember a sequence of events that led up to a particular
result. For instance, let’s say you are studying the forced
removal of the Cherokee tribe from their ancestral homelands
in Tennessee, North Carolina, and northern Georgia to the
newly created Indian Territory (Oklahoma) on the Trail of Tears
in 1838–39.
Your teacher states that the following factors led to
the Trail of Tears: Gold was discovered on Cherokee lands
in Georgia in 1828, the Indian Removal Act was passed by
Remember This
Beloved children’s author Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor
Seuss Geisel, doodled a lot in school. His boyhood home still shows
the marks of where he doodled on his bedroom walls. His teachers, for
the most part, did not understand his need to draw, and he frequently
got in trouble for daydreaming and sketching during class.
Although educators in his
time did not recognize it as such,
Geisel’s doodling was a learning
tool. Today, many teachers and
schools teach students that draw-
ing diagrams is an excellent way
to memorize difficult and complex
subject matter, such as historical
information. Educators call this tool
mind mapping, or using graphic
organizers. Ted Geisel had no idea
how this childhood “tool” would
shape his future.
In college, Geisel started to
draw cartoons for the student
newspaper. Afterward, he wrote a
children’s book that made learning
English fun. Geisel shopped the book around to nearly 30 publishers,
but everyone thought it was too far-out, too goofy to take seriously.
Eventually, one publisher saw Geisel’s genius and the rest is history.
Dr. Seuss became the world’s top-selling author of children’s books.

Congress in 1830, the U.S. Army forcibly took Cherokee lands
for settlement, and evicted Cherokee were imprisoned in mili-
tary stockades in early 1838. You would write down each of
these events in a circle and/or make simple drawings within
each circle to help you remember each event leading to a circle
titled “Trail of Tears, 1838–39.”
Your drawings and circles of information might look
something like the following.
These simple sketches might not mean much to anyone
else, but having a visual image you created to go along
with the material you are learning will help you recall the
information later.

SCHOLARSHIP 15
.The Genuine Value of School
Let’s say the information you need to mind map is not
sequential information; that is, the information is not a sequence
of events that led to a particular result, but rather, it is a variety
of factors that combined to create a new situation. For instance,
let’s say you are studying Great Britain’s motives for colonizing
North America. You would write the topic in a center circle. In
circles surrounding the center circle, you would write or draw
the motives. Then you would draw lines from each circle to
the center circle, like the spokes of a wheel. All circles lead to
the center circle.
A diagram of Great Britain’s motives for colonizing North
America might look like the following.
By using visual images and just a few words to describe
the subject, you will be much better able to recall the
information later.
Many students report that they remembered the drawings
they drew on the mind map better than the descriptive words.
Often, the drawing or doodle will help you recall the words
and difficult concepts described in the diagram.

.Improving Your Grades at School
Improving Your
Grades at School
For requirement 1, you must show that you earned an average
grade of B or higher for one term, or that you have improved
your grades over the previous term. What’s the best way to go
about doing this? Here is a simple step-by-step guide.
Organize Your Work Space
Find a place at home where you feel comfortable and where
you can focus on the task at hand. The place you select should
be well-lighted and relatively quiet at the time of day you will
be doing your homework. It also should have a sturdy chair
and a table or desk where you can
spread out your papers and books.
Clean the area thoroughly before
you start using it as your work space.
Next, equip your space with the tools
you need. If you use a computer,
think about the best location for it in
your work space. Be sure to gather
college- or wide-ruled paper, some
pens, a couple of pencils with good
erasers, a small pencil sharpener, a
ruler, a pair of scissors, a calculator,
and a highlighter. Small items can
be placed in a shoebox or other
container if the area you use has
multiple purposes and must be
shared with family members. Place
a dictionary, a thesaurus, and a wall
or desk calendar within easy reach.
Always put everything back in the
same place.


18 SCHOLARSHIP
Improving Your Grades at School.
Keep Your Work Space Organized
This ranks as its own category because it is the hardest thing
for some students to do, yet it makes all the difference in the
world. It should take less than three minutes to clean off your
desk or table thoroughly after each session. Stack your papers
in a neat pile, put your pens and materials back in the con-
tainer, and place reference books back where they belong. Save
any work you have done on the computer, then turn it off to
save energy. Recycle any wastepaper immediately.
If you wonder why this is important, think about the
impact of clutter and disorganization in your life. It can be
overwhelming and time-consuming if you let clutter take
over. Just finding things when they are buried under a pile of
rubble can consume a lot of time better spent otherwise and
can cause major frustration. Lighten your load: Clean up your
space each time you use it.
Schedule Homework Time Each Day
Write down homework time on your
calendar as a regular part of your schedule
during weekdays. Many students prefer to do
homework right after school so they can have
their evenings free. But, if you participate in
extracurricular activities right after school or
if you focus better after dinner or early in the
morning before school, choose the time that
works best for you. Just remember that once
you set your schedule it is up to you to keep
it, so be realistic.
After you finish your homework, make a
check mark on the calendar to indicate that
you studied that day and completed your
assignments. Be proud of each check mark
you make: It means you achieved your aca-
demic goals for the day.
If you are not assigned homework on a given day,
use your homework time to organize your school
papers and review your class notes, highlighting
the important information you think you will need
for tests.


SCHOLARSHIP 19
.Improving Your Grades at School
Organize Schoolwork by Subject
Nothing accumulates faster in your school life than paperwork.
If you are trying, like so many students, to stuff all your loose
papers, assignment sheets, and homework into the tight plastic
pocket of a three-ring binder, by the end of a semester, your
binder will look like a bursting blob straight out of a horror film.
Instead, tame the creepy beast. Group your papers by subject.
Count the number of subjects you are taking in school.
Then, purchase different colored pocket folders or—if you
expect a lot of paperwork—accordion folders for each subject
area. Using a black marker, clearly label the front of the folders
for each subject. Here’s the trick: Bring these folders with you
to class each day and use them to organize and store paper-
work as you receive it.
When your teacher gives you homework, handouts,
and other materials, immediately write the date on the top
of each sheet. Then place the materials in chronological order
inside the folder for that subject before you leave class.
If you forget to bring your folder to school one day or don’t
have time to organize your work before the end of class, add
the paperwork to the proper folder as soon as you get home.
Use a Pocket Organizer
to Track Your Academic
and Social Life
The pocket organizer, whether
it is electronic or paper, should
have large blank squares
or a place for notes under
each calendar day. Schedules
change quickly, so if you
are working on paper, use a
pencil or an erasable pen to
make notations. If you keep
your calendar on a phone,
computer, or tablet, talk
with your parent or guardian
about finding an app that
will help you remember
upcoming assignments.
With a busy
schedule, you
might sometimes
find it necessary
to study during the
ride home from
school, on the bus,
or during lunch.
That’s OK. You
might discover
you can focus
better with some
background music,
and that’s OK, too.


20 SCHOLARSHIP
Improving Your Grades at School.
First, write down when things are due or when tests are
scheduled. But don’t stop there. Jot down “Start studying for
math test” a week before the test date, or “Review internet
resources for science project” a month before you turn in your
erupting volcano. Add social and extracurricular activities to
your calendar, keeping in mind that your academic career is
your most important responsibility and that your hobbies and
social life should be balanced against that main duty.
Each week, transfer information from your pocket orga-
nizer or electronic notebook to your wall calendar so that
you have a clear idea of how your schedule looks. Keep your
pocket organizer with you each day at
school and update it regularly. The wall
calendar helps you follow your
schedule when you are at home and
apt to be thinking about other things.
It also provides you with a backup
calendar just in case you lose your
pocket organizer.
Never underestimate the power
of notes to jog your memory. If you
have ever marveled at someone’s
incredible organizational skills, rest
assured that most successful people
rely heavily on notes to stay on
track. This becomes crucial as you
add more social activities and
academic responsibilities to
your schedule.
If you choose requirement 2(c), take both your
pocket organizer and your backup calendar with
you to show your counselor how you organize
your time and track your academic and social life.

.Improving Your Grades at School
What Kind of Student Are You?
Get out a piece of paper. Answer the following questions honestly about
yourself. Remember, there are no wrong answers; this is just a guide to
help you see yourself as you are right now in your role as a student.
1. “Do I come to class prepared to pay attention? Am I curious about
what is being taught that day? Am I ready to learn?”
2. “Where do I normally sit in a classroom?” (In the back, front, middle,
or on the left or right side?)
3. “What is my normal posture at my desk?”
4. “Am I prepared for class with my textbook, notebook, subject folder,
pens, and pencils, or do I forget one or more of these items regularly?”
5. “Do I make direct eye contact with the teacher when he or she
is lecturing?”
6. “Do I take notes in class? Can I read my own handwriting later and
understand the general meaning of the topic?”
7. “Do I doodle or draw pictures in class? Do these pictures have
anything to do with helping me remember the subject and
information being presented?”
8. “Am I a good listener? Do I interrupt people when they speak, or do
I listen quietly until they are finished and then reply?”
9. “Do I participate in classroom discussion and feel comfortable
working in groups and on teams?”
10. “Do I pause to think before I speak, or do I frequently blurt out
things without thinking first?”
11. “Do I like school and feel that it benefits me in many ways?”
Review your answers. For each question you answered in a negative
way, now write down one positive thing you can do to change your
mind about the way you think about that aspect of yourself as it relates
to your education. For instance, if you answered question No. 3 with,
“I slouch forward and rest my chin on my desk,” your positive change
could be to sit up straight and be more attentive.
If you teach yourself to think positively and present a can-do spirit
in your learning and the way you interact with your peers and teachers,
positive change will happen in your academic life.

Learn Simple Test-Taking Strategies
When you prepare for tests, concentrate on one class at a time.
Decide which information from your notes and textbooks will
be important for you to learn for the test. Look at your courses
and set your study priorities based on which subject requires
more time to master. Always spend more time on tasks that
you find difficult and do the tough ones first.
Texas State University’s Student Learning Assistance
Center offers students the following tips for preparing for
tests. These tips are as important for elementary, junior
high, and high school students as they are for young adults
attending college.
If the test is a final, refer to earlier tests you have taken
and browse the table of contents in your books to review
the overall subject matter. Study your class notes, and read
any unread material or reread anything you did not quite
understand. Anticipate, as you are reading through the
material, the types of questions that might be on the test.
Think while you read. At the end of each page or section,
test yourself to help you remember what you read.
Focusing on the
negative aspects
of your life can
slow you down in
the same way a
parachute drags a
race car to a halt.
Positive thought
creates positive

Longer study periods are required to grasp broad concepts
and to understand relationships between ideas. Underline,
highlight, and summarize work, but do not spend your time
recopying your notes. Recall important points about the
various aspects of the course without looking at your notes
or in the book. If your memory draws a blank, review that
section again.
Math formulas, theories, definitions, and any complex
terms that you must memorize require short but frequent
practice sessions. As you review, test yourself at the end
of each page or
section to increase
your retention.
Reading com-
prehension questions
mainly involve read-
ing a passage or short
paragraph and then
answering questions
about it. Make sure
you read correctly the
test instructions and
questions. You might
find it helpful to read
the questions before
you read the passage.
The questions may
relate to the main
theme or to general
or detailed informa-
tion within the read-
ing material.
If you are at home
and bored, work
word puzzles, play
chess or checkers,
or play trivia and
geography games.
These fun side
pursuits can
help you improve
your recall and
strengthen your
memory bank.
Daily physical exercise, even if it is only a brisk
15- to 20-minute walk, and taking brief study
breaks will help your ability to concentrate and
provide you with more energy to burn. It is fine
to review material with others, but only after you
have studied the subject matter on your own and
feel confident that you know the material.

Use the Power of Positive Thinking
Train yourself to use the power of positive thought to improve
your test performance. Repeat positive statements to yourself
before taking tests. Tension and anxiety drain energy from your
test performance, so tell yourself that you will do well.
Whenever you achieve a goal, acknowledge to yourself
that you have succeeded. Give yourself a big pat on the back.
Remember this: Goals do change over time. It is OK to change
what you imagine to match changing goals.
To respond to an essay question on a test, begin
with a strong sentence that clearly states your
essay’s main idea. Below that, follow up with key
points that you plan to discuss. Expand upon your

Creative Visualization
Have you ever watched a downhill skier just before a final run
in the Olympics? Standing atop a snow-covered mountain, skiers
close their eyes and seem to imagine the course in their heads—
every turn and bump, every patch of ice and pocket of deep
powder—to the successful run to the bottom. Their hands move
back and forth as if gripping ski poles. In the skiers’ minds, they
are flying over the terrain faster than they’ve ever gone, effortlessly,
to the roar of cheers at the finish line. This technique is called
creative visualization. It is a simple technique that everyone
can use.
Every day, we use imagination without really thinking about it.
Throughout the day, a running conversation plays inside our heads
about other people, our own feelings, what we need to do from
minute to minute, and what is happening around us. These words
and ideas ultimately help shape and create our environment.
For instance, before artists paint a painting, they feel inspired. In
their heads, they see the painting or gather some idea of what it will
look like. Before architects design a house on paper, they mull over
the details in their minds. Before basketball players make a perfect
three-pointer from downtown, they imagine the ball leaving their
hands and hearing the sweet swish of the net.
Creative visualization can help you become aware of your
thoughts and engage in positive statements about your life and
what you do. The object is to set goals and go for what you want
in life, using creative visualization to guide you toward your
goals. The important thing is to use it to make positive change.
Energy tends to attract energy of a similar nature. When
we create something, we always create it in thought form first.
People consumed with negative thoughts tend to attract negative
people. People with positive attitudes tend to attract people,
situations, and events that match their positive expectations.
You constantly create the conditions in which you live your life.
Look at ways you might hold yourself back with negative feelings
and beliefs. Only you can choose the best, most fulfilling life
you can imagine.

How Your School Can Help You
Get Better Grades
Public schools operate under the umbrella of a statewide
academic curriculum that is passed by the legislature. This
means that students in each state must meet specific education
requirements, from passing courses to passing standardized
tests, before they can graduate from high school. These
educational requirements and the curriculum itself vary from
state to state.
If you are struggling in a subject and need tutoring, your
school might offer an after-school study program. Schools
sometimes offer internet-based tutoring. Give the tutor your
undivided attention, and don’t be afraid to ask the person to
repeat, explain, or expand on any points that are unclear to
you. Return to the study center as often as needed to become
comfortable, knowledgeable, and confident about the subject.
If your parents or guardian are working with you to help
you understand a subject better, ask your school if your state
provides a study guide for your grade level and the subject in


SCHOLARSHIP 27
.Improving Your Grades at School
which you need help. For instance, if you are in the sixth grade
and are having difficulty with math, talk to your guidance
counselor or the teacher to get the help you need. Don’t put it
off: Be sure to get help as soon as you think you need it.
In some states, study guides might be available online.
They usually are written by teachers who have a great deal of
experience in that particular subject. The guides are written in
plain language so that parents or guardian and students can
easily understand the requirements of a course and how to
go about meeting them. Often, spending just a week working
chapter by chapter through a study guide is enough to achieve
an overall comprehension of the subject.
Standardized tests required by your state normally are
released to the public every few years. Most states will publish
the tests online so that students can use them to practice for
the one they will be required to pass.
Check out your state educa-
tion agency’s student testing or
student assessment division to
see what resources and practice
materials are available online.

Dr. Vicente Villa*
Until Dr. Vicente Villa retired
from his teaching post in
the spring of 2003, students
could not hide from one of
his 8 a.m. biology labs at
Southwestern University
(SU) in Georgetown, Texas.
If students were absent, the
professor phoned them at
home to find out why they
were not in class. Simply
put, the man cares.
Dr. Vicente Villa, professor
emeritus of biology and
holder of the John H. Duncan
Chair (retired 2003), was
named U.S. Professor of the
Year in 1993 by the Council
for Advancement and Support of Education. Among other honors
awarded with this title, he received a $10,000 cash prize from the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
He was chosen for the national award over 389 candidates from
public and independent universities across the country. The decision
to recognize Villa for his extraordinary commitment to teaching was
based in large part on the strength of support from his current and
former SU undergraduate students.
Part parent, part teacher, part pit bull with a strong appetite for
science education, Dr. Villa is in a class all his own. Throughout his
teaching career, he remained dedicated to his students’ personal and
professional welfare. His former students speak of him as though he
belongs to them personally,
A Mexican American from Laredo, Texas, Villa worked as a shoe-
shine boy on the banks of the Rio Grande River. Villa’s father was


SCHOLARSHIP 29
.Improving Your Grades at School
one of the last of the Mexican vaqueros, or cowboys, who eked out a
living along the U.S.-Mexico border. Villa’s mother was legally blind.
Neither of his parents had much of an education and both wanted
their children to reach for a better future. They encouraged young
Vicente to excel.
Villa says, “The bottom line is perseverance. Don’t give up. Be a
fighter. Those experiences really saved me.” After he finished Laredo
Junior College, Villa completed a B.S. in biology at the University of
Texas at Austin and a Ph.D. in microbiology at Rice University.
When he arrived at Southwestern University in 1985, few of the
university’s Hispanic students majored in the sciences. Villa set out to
change that and he worked with great energy to encourage science
students to pursue medical, research, and teaching careers. In 1993,
more than half of Villa’s graduating students were admitted to the
nation’s top medical schools. Today, more than 10 percent of those
graduating from SU with biology degrees are Hispanic.
An animated lecturer and deeply spiritual man, Villa exudes a
passion for science. A colleague recalls watching Villa lecture: “Dr. Villa
was waving his arms around wildly and moving fluidly—almost with
the grace of a dancer, which is really remarkable when you consider
that Vicente is not exactly a small man. Later on, I saw Vicente in the
hall and asked him what he had been lecturing about so excitedly.
He replied, ‘When you lecture on the amoeba, you must imitate
the amoeba!’”
Class after class, year after year, the following words rang in the
ears of Villa’s students: “Be a scholar! I urge you! Do the extra things
that will make all this worthwhile!”
Now that he is retired, Villa plans to create an outreach program
and perhaps a laboratory on wheels: “I want to bring a hands-on
approach to science to children at a younger age. The way we are
teaching science at this level is not turning kids on. I think we can
do better.”

of the Year,” Southwestern magazine, fall 1993; and D. Ann Shiffler, “Mr. Homecoming,”

and new pathways and adventures become possible when
exploring interests with a curious mind and an open heart.
Libraries, museums, state archives, historical societies,

wildlife exhibits, zoos, folk festivals, and state fairs are just
some of the places where you can acquire a self-education.
Get out there and teach yourself what you want to know!
If you choose requirement 2(a), you will write a brief but
concise one-page report on what you learned at the place you
chose for self-education. Take a notepad, two pens or pencils,
and perhaps a pen light with you. If you take notes electroni-

and how it may relate to subjects you are studying in school.
Should you choose requirement 2(b), you will need to
get your counselor’s and parent or guardian’s approval before
you interview the two professionals who have challenging and
rewarding careers. Phone interviews often are much easier to
arrange when you are dealing with busy people. Before you
call, have in front of you a notepad, pens or pencils, your cal-
endar, and the questions you want to ask.
First, identify two professional people you or your parents
or guardian know (not your teachers or other school person-
nel) whom you admire or respect. This could be the owner of
a small business, a doctor, nurse, plumber, architect, builder,
electrician, computer programmer, journalist, political activist,
photographer, or anyone with a career you would like to learn
more about.
Next, write down five questions you would like to ask
each person you plan to interview. Here are some examples.
• Where did you receive the education
or training you needed to do this work?
• How did your education and training
prepare you for your career?
• What do you find most rewarding
about your profession?
• What is the most challenging or dif-
ficult aspect of your position?
• What types of events or activities do
you participate in to help you continue
to educate yourself in the subjects that
interest you?
Third, contact the two people by phone.
(Remember to have your questions, your
calendar, a notebook, and two pens or
pencils in front of you.) State your name
clearly and the reason you are calling:
“Hi, Mr. Martin. My name is Bob Barton.

sional people who have careers I’m interested in learning more
about. Would it be possible to arrange a time when I could do
a brief phone interview with you to talk about your profession
and how you got where you are today?”
If the person responds yes, politely ask for a sugges-
tion of a specific time for you to call back. Confirm the time
and date of the interview by repeating it back to the person.
Immediately write down the interview time and the person’s
name and phone number on your calendar. Then, thank
the person in advance for taking the time to talk to you and
say goodbye. Don’t forget to follow through and call for the
interview at the exact time you promised.
Often, when you approach a person about conducting
a brief phone interview, he or she will agree to do it at that
instant. That is why it is a good idea to have your questions
written out and ready to ask. If the person says, “Sure, go
ahead. Shoot,” say thanks and then ask your questions one
at a time. Be careful to write down only the gist of what the
person says in response and not every single word that is said.
Once you finish the phone interview, review your notes
quickly and make sure you have everything you need. If you
want to ask a follow-up question that occurred to you during
the interview, this is the time to do so. Ask the person if you
can call again in case you have forgotten something important
or want to confirm something that was said. Lastly, thank the
person generously for taking the time and for helping you with
your merit badge requirement. Then say goodbye.
Immediately rewrite your
interview notes into a brief,
one-page report that details
the person’s responses to your
five questions. Review your
report a few times before
presenting it to your counselor.
Then you will be prepared to
paraphrase without reading
your notes aloud.

to remember as

someone is to be

The Classics Will Come Back to
Haunt You—In a Good Way
Before you graduate from high school, you will be required
to read a few classics. Reading classics can be challenging
because the language often is different or more complex than
the language we use today. However, reading classics is highly
rewarding. Not only will you improve your vocabulary, but you
also will learn the sources of some of the most important ideas
in human history.
Classic literature includes those literary works widely read
throughout history and valued for their influence on culture
and society. Classic works span the centuries, from Greek and
Roman literature to modern day. These works explore many of
the same themes that are important to us today, only they do
so from the perspective of the period in which they were writ-
ten. The more you read, the broader your perspective on current
events will be, and the better able you will be to think critically
about the impact of current events on you and your community.
Reading classics
is a wonderful
opportunity to
see how people
in the past viewed
many of the
same issues that
concern us today.


SCHOLARSHIP 35
.Intellectual Curiosity: Your Passport to the World
Likewise, reading classic literature is an opportunity to
delve into the richness of language and the similarities and
differences of people’s experiences over time. You also can
observe the common features of storytelling and how the
features of storytelling have stayed the same or changed
through the ages.
Ask your school or local librarian for a list of classic
literature and devour great books like potato chips. As you
read, think about the main idea of the book and its underlying
themes and social commentary. Is the subject or general
theme of the book similar to the themes of other books you
have read in the past? Common themes include hope, courage,
redemption, human failing, love and loss, discipline, and
sacrifice. How is the author’s writing influenced by the era
in which he or she lived? Also watch for literary devices that
shape the story, such as “flat” characters who only appear in
a single scene to move the plot along and “round” characters
whom you get to know intimately and are elaborated upon
throughout the book.

Reading takes you far and helps you grow, from the lessons learned
to “experiencing” distant places you may never actually visit. A
good place to start is with the classics, books you might be assigned
to read before you graduate from high school. The more classic
literature you have read in your youth, the more valuable and well-
rounded your overall education becomes in adulthood.
Here is a short list to help get you started.
Mark Twain used humor and satire to
comment on important issues in American
society, such as slavery. His well-regarded
novels include Tom Sawyer, The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn, and A Connecticut
Yankee in King Arthur’s Court.

If you have a hard time reading or if you read slowly,
try classic books that have been turned into graphic novels.
Pictures are worth a thousand words and improve remember-
ing. Likewise, sometimes the themes explored in classics are
difficult to understand. Study guides, such as SparkNotes and
Monarch Notes, are available for most classics. Study guides
are particularly helpful if you are reading a classic book on
your own and want to better understand its plot and themes.
However, these guides should not take the place of actually
reading the book.
Study guides like these can enhance your understanding of
classic books such as The Great Gatsby.

.Methods of Research
Methods of Research
If you choose requirement 2(d), you will need to discuss
with your counselor the advantages and disadvantages of
the different methods of research available to you for school
assignments, such as the library, books and periodicals,
and the internet.
Libraries
Public libraries were, are, and always will be an important
primary research tool for students, teachers, and people who
do research as a profession. Your public library not only gives
you free access to books, periodicals, and the internet, but it
also gives you access to reference librarians.
A trained librarian
can help you
find resources
you did not know
existed. A librar-
ian knows how to
cross-reference
your subject
under different
but related terms
to find the maxi-
mum number of
resources for
you to use.


40 SCHOLARSHIP
Methods of Research.
If the book or periodical you need is not available at your
local library, you can request an interlibrary loan. Your librarian
will request the book from the nearest public library that has
the book. When the book arrives at your local library, you can
check it out. The retrieval process usually takes no more than
10 days. Your librarian can tell you more about this service. If
you have internet access, you may be able to read your book
online with your parent or guardian’s permission. You can
try to find the publication by using a search engine such as
Google. (See the resources section at the end of this pamphlet.)
Books and Periodicals
Books are excellent resources for learning about historical
events. Remember to look for different perspectives by reading
books on the same subject written by authors with different
points of view. For instance, if you were researching Custer’s
last stand at the Battle of Little Bighorn, you might read the
personal papers of General Custer and rent a documentary on
the battle to get an overview of what happened. But, you also
might want to read Black Elk Speaks, a transcript of conversa-
tions with Nicholas Black Elk, to get the perspective of the
Sioux and Cheyenne warriors who fought in that battle.
The Reader’s Guide to Periodical
Literature is the ultimate research tool
at the library. No matter what topic you
research, someone has published a paper
or magazine or newspaper article about it.
In larger research libraries, periodical lit-
erature is stored on microfilm and is avail-
able for you to read.
Rare or out-of-
print books and
reference books
usually are not
available for
lending. If that is
the case, you will
have to read them
at the library.
If you are researching a current
event, look for information about
it in periodicals such as magazines
and newspapers. Remember to
read more than one source to get
different perspectives on
the subject.


SCHOLARSHIP 41
.Methods of Research
Ask your librarian to show you how to access these
materials. Again, use the internet to search for a periodical
online. (See the resources section for web addresses and more
information.)
Your public library also is a good place to check and
recheck your facts. If you are unsure about any factual
information, try to find three independent, reputable sources
that will confirm your material. Write down the author and
publisher information as you did for your other references.
This way, you can readily refer to the specific citations and
back up your statements with the published sources. If a teach-
er questions your research, you can readily refer to the specific
citation and back it up with other published sources.
Unfortunately, libraries often have limited hours and are
not always open when you need to find something fast. If you
live in a small town or even a big town with a small budget,
your public library might not have the materials you need
without requesting them through interlibrary loan. You might
not have time to wait for materials to arrive from elsewhere.
That’s when the internet can help.
For examples of
what citations
look like, see
the resources
section at the
back of this merit
badge pamphlet.
Whenever you refer to a book, magazine, CD,
newspaper, or other published source in a report
or project, be sure to give proper credit to the
author and publisher. It is OK to use brief quotes
from published sources as long as you properly
credit your source by including the author’s name,
date of publication, article title, publication title,
publisher, and page numbers in a footnote or
resource section.
Use direct quotes sparingly, however. Most of
the time, you should record information by taking
notes in your own words as you read through the
research materials. Use these notes to create your
report or project. Whether you use direct quotes
or your own words, it is important to be able to
show that you have the evidence to support
your statements.


42 SCHOLARSHIP

The Internet
The internet is a grand resource for academic research. Its
biggest advantage is that it is fast, and it is available 24
hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Plus, the
self-education you can get on the internet is almost limitless.
A click of your mouse will get you to a good search engine
(see the resources section at the end of this pamphlet) where
you can search by subject area, title, author, historical period,
location, event, important names, organization names, or key
phrases. Most websites also have a built-in search feature.
For example, a costume designer can access costume
collections and museums online to find the perfect period
clothing for a historic play set in 18th-century India. What
used to take days and weeks to research can now take only
a few hours.

.Methods of Research
By the same token, a doctor working in a remote part
of the world can connect to the internet via satellite to get
information on medical treatments. The internet has radically
changed the way we obtain information.
However, be aware that much of the information available
on the internet is incorrect. Anyone can post information on the
internet. Sometimes people post false information intentionally,
but most of the time people pass along incorrect information
without knowing it.
When researching on the internet, it is particularly
important to only rely on professional, reputable sources of
information, no matter how trivial the information might be.
Let’s say you want to look up an NBA score from last night’s
game. You could check the Associated Press (AP), an estab-
lished, respected newspaper wire service, or you could visit
the official NBA website.
If you need up-to-the-minute information on breaking
news, AP, Reuters, the New York Times, CNN, the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and hundreds of other
credible news sources are instantly available on the internet.
However, even news organizations have accidentally spread
inaccurate information. If the story is still developing, check
several news sources and use your critical reading skills to
make sure you are getting the most accurate information.
The great advantage to using the internet is that you have
the entire world at your fingertips. Anything and everything is
mentioned online. Just remember to click on your own good
judgment before you log on, and to get your parent or
guardian’s permission first.
Make sure to read news sources carefully to help
determine what is fact, opinion, and interpretation.
Information often can look or sound very similar,
and it can be easy to mistake an opinion for fact.

Tips for Online Safety
On the internet, you can learn all sorts of things, click your way to a wide
world of instant information, and even read whole books. Along with the
convenience, though, comes some risk. When you are online, you need
to be careful to guard your privacy and protect yourself from potentially
harmful situations.
These tips will help you stay safe. Your parent, guardian, counselor,
or librarian may talk with you about other rules for internet safety. When
you are at a library, you may also ask a librarian for a copy of that par-
ticular library’s internet rules.
1. Follow your family’s rules for going online. Respect any limits on how
long and how often you are allowed to be online and what sites you can
visit. Do not visit areas that are off-limits. Just as there are places you
don’t go to in real life, there are places to avoid on the internet.


SCHOLARSHIP 45
.Methods of Research
2. Protect your privacy. Never exchange emails or give out personal
information such as your phone number, your address, your last
name, where you go to school, or where your parents or guardians
work, without first asking your parent or guardian’s permission. Do
not send anyone your picture or any photographs unless you have
your parent or guardian’s permission.
3. Do not open emails or files you receive from people you don’t
know or trust. If you get something suspicious, trash it just as you
would any other junk mail.
4. If you receive or discover any information that makes you
uncomfortable, leave it and tell your parent or guardian. Do not
respond to any message that is disturbing or hurtful.
5. Never agree to get together with someone you “meet” online,
unless your parent or guardian approves of the meeting and goes
with you.
6. Never share your internet password with anyone (even if they
sound “official”) other than your parents or guardian or other
responsible adults in your family.
7. Never shop online unless you have your parent or guardian’s
permission to do so.
8. Do not believe everything you see or read online. Along with lots
of great information, the internet has lots of junk. Learn to separate
the useful from the worthless. Talk with your counselor or other
experienced web user about ways to tell the difference.
9. Be a good online citizen. Do not do anything that harms others or is
against the law.

Prairie Junior High School
Before the appointment, practice the points you want to
make about your performance. Rehearse your informal speech
several times in front of a mirror. Be honest, confident, and
upbeat in your appraisal of yourself, but avoid boasting.
Type a brief note and print it in memo form. You can use
the model below to craft your own note.


SCHOLARSHIP 49
.Scholarship and You
Dress neatly for your appointment, and arrive on time.
Have the note ready for the principal to sign and your index
cards handy. State the reason for your visit. “As part of the
requirements for my Scouts BSA merit badge in scholarship,
I need a signed note from you stating that my behavior,
leadership, and service in school have been satisfactory this
past year.”
You might begin by saying something like the following:
“During the past year, I brought my grades up to Bs by paying
better attention in class and taking better notes. I’ve been
involved in class projects in both history and English that have
required teamwork and academic leadership skills. I have
learned to manage my time effectively by using a pocket
organizer and turning in my homework on time. In addition
to balancing school with my extracurricular activities, such
as Scouting and basketball
practice, this past semester
I tutored my next-door
neighbor, who is having
a hard time in math.”
Then, simply state the
bulleted information on your
index cards, being careful to
look up from your notes and
make eye contact with your
principal in a friendly manner
at least a few times during
your presentation.
In conclusion, politely
ask your principal to sign
the note you have prepared.
Indicate that the note will
only be used to show your
merit badge counselor that
you have fulfilled the merit
badge requirement. After the
principal signs your note, make eye contact, smile broadly,
and shake hands as you say thank you. Then, leave quietly,
with your signed note and index cards in hand. If the principal
would like more time to review your academic records, leave
the note with the principal and politely ask when you can
return to pick it up. Remember your best etiquette whenever
you are dealing with anyone in a position of authority.
When you meet with your principal or other school
official, make eye contact, smile widely, and shake
hands. This creates an instant impression that you
are confident, comfortable, and mature.

Teamwork, School Projects, and
Extracurricular Activities
If you choose requirement 4(a), you will discuss with your
counselor the benefits of your participation in an extracurricular
school activity and what you have learned about the importance
of teamwork.
If you have been a Scout for any length of time, you already
have learned a great deal about the importance of teamwork.
Campfires do not get built, meals do not get cooked, cleanup
does not happen, and campfire programs do not get created
or presented without plenty of teamwork on troop and patrol
outings. When everyone pitches
in and lends positive thoughts
and action to a team effort, it is
amazing how quickly and effi-
ciently things get done. The more
your troop works together, the
more well-oiled the teamwork
machine becomes.
The ability to work well with
others is one of the most impor-
tant skills you can bring to work,
friendships, school, society, and
life. The more brainpower and
perspectives a group can devote to
a problem or challenge, the better
the overall results will be. Being
part of a team involves keeping
on task, speaking and acting
positively, trusting your team
members, working closely with
people from varying backgrounds,
and believing that the decisions
reached by the group are stronger
than those made by one person.
Think about the extra-
curricular activities in which
you participate. How have you
benefited from joining a group
activity or organization? Write
down all of the activities in which
you participate, and include two


SCHOLARSHIP 51
.Scholarship and You
or three positive benefits you have gained from your participa-
tion in each.
For instance, let’s say you play on the school baseball or
softball team. Since joining the team, your batting average has
improved a little, and your overall hand-eye coordination and
body strength has increased with daily workouts. In addition,
not only have you learned the joy of winning and the benefits
of team play, but you also have learned how to perform well
under pressure. When your team lost, you learned how to be
a good sport by letting go of disappointment, resolving to do
better next time, and shaking hands and congratulating the
opposing team.
Now, write down at least two or three reasons why
teamwork is important to the success of your extracurricular
activities. Think about your attitude toward others on the
team. Are you able to work well with people, even those you
don’t particularly like or those outside of your social group? Do
you respect what others have to say? Under what circumstances
are you able to compromise for the good of the group? Do you
listen to the opinions of other people? Do you do your best to
encourage other team members to participate in positive ways?
Do you believe in a decision-making process that gives each
person in the group an opportunity to contribute to the team’s
goals? Think about it. You couldn’t play baseball by yourself.
You need a pitcher, a batter, a catcher, and other players in the
infield and outfield. You need a coach.
What do the other team members bring to the table? How
can your group highlight an individual’s personal strengths and
play down his or her weaknesses? Are there team members
who don’t participate because they are afraid of making a mis-
take or failing? What positive, welcoming signs can you give
to help people feel more secure in the group and more capable
of contributing ideas without fear of rejection? How have you
encouraged team members to share their best ideas? Do you
readily include everyone in plans and decision making? Or, are
you a member of a clique within a group, excluding certain
team members or frequently putting down their ideas and
input? Do you judge others too quickly or hold grudges against
those who make mistakes?
If you are completing requirement 4(a), write down four
short sentences that detail the benefits you have gained from
participating in an extracurricular activity.
Teamwork
requires patience,
the ability to
compromise and
lead by example,
and good listening
and speaking
skills. It requires
follow-through to
ensure that group
ideas lead to
successful results.


52 SCHOLARSHIP
Scholarship and You.
Next, think about the importance of teamwork in that
extracurricular activity. You might remember a small incident
that was best resolved by team members working together or
a larger project that required everyone’s best efforts to make
it successful. Perhaps you went to a team member who was
stronger than you are in a specific skill and asked for help to
improve your own performance and that of the team. Or, you
might have been the one who helped a teammate with some
part of the work that was particularly difficult. Your team may
have learned more from its mistakes this year than from its
successes. Explain how your team’s setbacks helped the team
work better together.
If you choose requirement 4(b), discuss with your coun-
selor your participation in a school project during the past
semester where you were part of a team. Write down the specif-
ic positive contributions you made to the team and the project.
Explain how you contributed to the project’s success.
Think of contributions to the project made by other team
members that you particularly appreciated. How did the group’s
attitude affect your team overall? Discuss what you learned
that will help make you a better team member in the future.

Prepare for College While You Are
in High School
In your freshman year of high school, start talking to your
school counselor, teachers, friends, and parents or guardian
about college. Find out where they went, what courses they
took, what activities they did, and what campus social life
was like.
Buy or borrow a college directory that features detailed
descriptions of universities and colleges. College directories
also are available on the internet. Make sure to visit the
websites of specific colleges you want to learn more about.
Life After
High School
A solid high
school education
will give you a
good start with
learning how to
think and make
good decisions.
After graduation
you can put your
skills to work
at college or
perhaps pursue
a career that
requires technical
knowledge or
utilizes your
artistic talents.


54 SCHOLARSHIP
Scholarship and You.
If your family takes a vacation between your freshman
and sophomore year and you are traveling near colleges you
would like to visit, ask if you can take a side trip to see them.
Make an appointment with the college admissions office in
advance so you and your parents or guardian can receive a
private or group tour.
If you don’t know what subject area you would like to
pursue as your major, consider the courses you particularly
like in high school. Your school counselor’s office might offer
career assessment tests that will help you match your skills to
a career. Look up colleges that have strong academic programs
in the fields you might want to pursue.
Then check out the campus environment. Where will you
be comfortable for at least four years? Do you like rural or urban
settings? What kind of climate do you enjoy? Do you want to
attend a big school with a large student body or a small school
with limited class sizes? Check out the teacher-to-student ratio
in your reference guide.
You also should consider the kind of social life you lead,
your hobbies, and the kinds of activities the college offers. If you
like coffeehouses, movies, and live theater, you probably will
not want to attend a rural school where the featured activities
are backpacking and mountain climbing. By the same token, if
you like peaceful country living, you might not enjoy going to
college in the heart of New York City.
Write to the colleges in which you are interested. Ask for a
packet of information about the school. Visit the colleges long
enough to poke around campus, sit in on a class, and look at
the residence halls. Eat at the campus cafeteria and do not be
afraid to ask current students what the college is like and what
they like or dislike about it. Feel out and observe every aspect
of campus life that you can.
Narrow down the choices by the end of your junior year
in high school. Look at the college application form for each
of the schools to which you want to apply. Get a clear idea of
each school’s admission requirements. You will begin applying
to colleges in your senior year, but by then, you will have a
tremendous advantage because of the knowledge you gained
by starting the process early.
Research
scholarships and
grants in your
junior year
(numerous
reference guides
can be found
in your library)
and record on
your calendar
the deadlines by
which you must
apply during your
senior year.


SCHOLARSHIP 55
.Scholarship and You
Along with your application form, you likely will have to
submit a 500-word essay on a topic of the college’s choice. You
may be asked to write an essay about your own life, someone
you admire, a memorable experience, or a political or social
issue. Some colleges also require you to answer a few open-
ended questions about your decision to apply or your favorite
book or hobby and what you enjoy about it most.
When writing your
essay, keep in
mind that the key
to a successful
essay is revealing
what makes you
uniquely you
and not just
providing the
“right” answer.
Application forms do not vary much between colleges or from
year to year. The form you fill out will ask a fairly standard set
of questions about your test scores, education, extracurricular
activities, and family background.


56 SCHOLARSHIP
Scholarship and You.
Standardized exit-level high school tests and college
entrance test scores, along with a high school transcript that
shows your grades and overall grade point average, also
will be required. Usually, colleges require that you take the
ACT Assessment and three SAT II Subject Tests or the SAT I
Reasoning Test. You can’t go wrong taking the International
Baccalaureate (IB) or Advanced Placement (AP) tests as well.
In your sophomore or junior year, you will take the PSAT,
a practice test to prepare you for the SAT I. Do not be fooled
into thinking that the PSAT does not matter. The score from
your junior year PSAT is used to determine whether you will
qualify for scholarships and grants, including the National
Merit Scholarships. These come with a cash prize that will help
with your college tuition. Study for the PSAT by purchasing a
PSAT study guide, reading through it several times, and taking
some practice tests. This will help you become comfortable
with the types of questions these tests ask. Be sure also to take
advantage of resources available at your school; talk to your
guidance counselor to find out what is available.
Colleges also look at
how well-rounded your
skills are. This is where
extra-curricular activities
become important. Get
involved in things that
interest you. If you like
writing, join the student
newspaper or yearbook
staff. If you like sports, try
out for the team of your
choice. There is no magic
number of activities you
need to be involved in to
secure the interest of a
college, so pursue hob-
bies and activities that are
interesting to you. Remember to keep a record of what you
do and of any awards or special recognitions you receive. It is
easy to forget information as you move through high school
and college, so keep a list and store it in a safe place.


SCHOLARSHIP 57
.Scholarship and You
Foster good relationships with your teachers, counselors,
and employers. You will need evaluations or recommendations
from various people to get into a good college, so start devel-
oping those relationships now. Be an active participant in the
classroom. Ask questions. If the teacher asks for a volunteer
in class, raise your hand. In other words, show that you care
about your education.
When the time comes to ask for a letter of recommendation,
your employers, teachers, and counselors should know you
pretty well and have glowing things to say about your character.
Use the resources
available to
you. Ask your
counselor for
help with college
planning.
Seek guidance and advice from people in positions of
authority whom you respect, and be open with them
about your goals and interests so they know you are
motivated and goal-oriented.





SCHOLARSHIP 59
.Education and Your Future
Education and
Your Future
You are now heading down the home stretch toward your
Scholarship merit badge.
If you choose requirement 5(a), you will write a report
of 250 to 300 words about how the education you receive
in school will be of value to you in the future and how you
will continue to educate yourself in the future. Even if you
don’t know what career you would like to pursue as an adult,
consider as you write your report how your education in
school will help you throughout life, regardless of the career
you choose.
Begin your report by stating your enrolled grade, what
school you attend, and how long you have attended that school.
For instance, you might begin, “I am a seventh grade student
at Rockland Junior High School. I moved to Rockland from
Storyville last year and have just started to feel at home here.”
Next, describe the classes you are taking currently and
how what you are learning in each will help you in the future
in some practical way. For instance, you might say, “I now
take math, English literature, social studies, science, and art.
Each of my classes teaches me skills I can use to learn and
try new things.”
Then, for each course you are taking, write a paragraph
that describes the basic skills you are learning and how what
you are learning can be applied in everyday life.
The last paragraph of your report should detail how you
will continue to educate yourself in the future. This is where
you can describe your specific areas of interest—academic or
otherwise—and how you plan to learn more about them. For
example, you might want to learn how to play guitar by taking
group lessons and practicing in your room each day. Or, your


60 SCHOLARSHIP
Education and Your Future.
goal might be to volunteer at a local theater in exchange
for seeing performances for free. Your goal might be to join
a running club and gradually work up to completing a
half marathon.
Whatever you decide, use the last paragraph to describe
how you plan to use education to better yourself and the
quality of your life.
Should you choose requirement 5(b) to complete your
merit badge requirements, you will write a report of 250 to 300
words about two careers that interest you. Your report should
include how specific classes and good scholarship will help you
achieve your career goals. Go to the library and research educa-
tional or technical training needed to pursue these careers. Ask a
reference librarian to show you where the latest college guides
are, then check to see which colleges and universities in the
United States provide that training.
Research and write down the type of education you will
need to obtain a position in the fields of your choice. Then,
write down the colleges or technical institutes where you can
receive training in those fields. Check college guides (see the
resources section at the back of this book) to find out about the
entrance requirements of the universities or training institutes
you have selected. If career planning is done as part of the
coursework at your school, use the resources available there.
If you have
internet access,
research the
careers online.
Scholarships, which can dramatically reduce the cost of
your college education, are available for nearly every
professional pursuit. Find out about the scholarships
available to people who want to enter the fields you have
selected. Also, check to see what types of scholarships
and grants are available from the college you would like
to attend, and find out what is required to apply.
An excellent starting point is to ask the school’s
guidance counselor, who can be an invaluable resource
in finding scholarships for which you may be eligible.
Your counselor can also recommend reference books
or online resources for finding scholarships.


SCHOLARSHIP 61
.Education and Your Future
Colleges sometimes will publish a list of recommended
subjects that high school students should take to prepare for
college study. See if you can find out which classes will best
prepare you for college. If you have a hard time finding this
information, ask your school counselor for help.
Scouting America also has a scholarship program for
Scouts. If any member of your family or an ancestor has ever
served in the U.S. military, you can apply for one of several
American Legion scholarships. Many of these scholarships
require you to write a patriotic essay on a theme picked by the
organization offering the scholarship. Other scholarships are
available for students who obedience train a dog or who con-
tribute a winning recipe to a contest.
Now that you have a clear idea of the education you will
need to pursue the two careers you have chosen, research the
career opportunities in those fields. You might interview some-
one working in the profession to get an idea of the classes that
are particularly helpful to take and the type of work or intern-
ships that will help you get experience in that field.
You can write a 250- to 300-word report on both careers,
or a 125- to 150-word report on each career. Just remember
to elaborate on how good scholarship in general will help you
achieve your career goals.
Federal grants, such as the Pell grant, are available to
students whose families have financial need. Students
can apply for these federal funds and the grants are
awarded based on the family’s income.
