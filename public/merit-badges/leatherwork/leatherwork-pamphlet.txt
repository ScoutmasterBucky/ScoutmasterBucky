LEATHERWORK 7
.Welcome to the World of Leatherwork
Welcome to the World
of Leatherwork
From the beginning of civilization to today’s high-tech world,
leather has served and enriched the lives of humans in many
ways. No other natural material offers such variety and quality.
Whether you are interested in creating pictures in leather
or making articles to be used or worn—including belts, foot-
wear, wallets, sporting equipment, horse gear, historic reenact-
ment garments, armor, sheaths, holsters, drums, and pouches—
leather is one of the most versatile and long-lasting materials
known. It can be molded, shaped, decorated, laced, stitched,
glued, sewn, colored, and
finished in many different ways.
As you complete the require-
ments to earn the Leatherwork
merit badge, you will explore
leather’s history and its endless
uses. You will learn to make a
useful leather item using the
same types of raw materials that
your ancestors used, and you
will be challenged to master
skills like hand-stitching, lacing,
and braiding. You will learn how
to preserve and protect leather
items so they will last your
lifetime and beyond.
As you practice the leather-
working techniques required
for the merit badge, you are
encouraged to use your creativity
and imagination, and most of all,
have FUN!

.Safety and First Aid
Safety and First Aid
Many tools used in leatherworking have sharp cutting edges.
They can be grouped into three major categories, depending on
how they are used:
• Tools that are pushed (edgers, gouges, skivers, and
some knives)
• Tools that are pulled (swivel knives, utility knives,
groovers, and strap cutters)
• Tools that are struck (punches and chisels)
Make sure your tools are sharp—a dull cutting tool is
dangerous. Grip them firmly to ensure complete control. Never
put any part of your body in the path of a cutting edge. A piece
of cardboard rubbed with jeweler’s rouge should be used for
honing the swivel and utility knife blades.
Many dyes, cements, and finishes used in leatherworking
contain hazardous chemicals. To safely use these materials,
work in a well-ventilated area. Carefully read and follow all
label instructions and warnings. Never ingest these chemicals
or allow them to come in contact with skin. Protect your hands
by wearing rubber gloves. Replace caps and lids to avoid spills.
Never use chemicals near an open flame. Have a doctor or
emergency medical service telephone number handy in case of
an emergency.
Prevention goes hand in hand with mitigation,
which means “to lessen in force or intensity” and
“to make less severe.” By taking precautions to
manage risk and the possibility of injury, you can
be prepared to anticipate, help prevent, mitigate,
and respond to just about any incident that might
happen while leatherworking.

Safety and First Aid.
First-Aid Practices
To help ensure that your experience in working with
leather will be both safe and fun, review the basic first-aid
instructions given below before beginning to work with
leather. See the First Aid merit badge pamphlet for more
information on treating injuries.
Skin Irritation
Some dyes, cements, and finishes may cause redness, a burning
sensation, itching, or swelling if they come into contact with skin.
HOW TO TREAT
• Wash the affected area with soap and water.
• Seek medical attention immediately if the irritation continues.
Ingested Poisoning
Poisoning is the most frequent cause of accidental death among
young children. They will swallow almost anything, including the
chemicals used in leatherworking, so store such materials well out
of their reach.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, stomach pains, vomiting,
burns around the mouth, and erratic breathing. Often the most
important sign of poisoning is the presence of the poison—open
bottles, spilled chemicals, or other evidence of what might have
been swallowed.
HOW TO TREAT
• Immediately find a telephone, taking any poison containers you find
along with you.
• Call the poison control center toll-free at 800-222-1222, the local
emergency center at 9-1-1, or an operator, and follow the
instructions you are given.
• Treat the victim for shock and monitor breathing.
• Do not give anything by mouth unless you are told to do so
by medical professionals.


LEATHERWORK 11
.Safety and First Aid
Cuts, Scratches, and Puncture Wounds
Cuts and scratches are wounds—openings in the skin and tissues that
can allow germs to enter the body and cause infection.
Puncture wounds can be dangerous because they allow germs
into a wound that is hard to clean.
Remember, anyone suffering a serious wound should be treated
for shock and seen by a physician immediately.
HOW TO TREAT
For minor scratches and cuts:
• Wash the wound with soap and water.
• Apply antiseptic to help prevent infection.
• Keep the wound clean by covering it with an adhesive bandage.
For larger cuts:
• Apply direct pressure to stop bleeding.
• Clean the wound as much as possible to limit infection.
• Cover an open wound with a sterile gauze pad or clean cloth folded
into a pad. Hold the pad in position with tape, a cravat bandage, or
other binder.
For puncture wounds:
• Encourage the wound
to bleed to help
remove anything
that might have been
forced inside.
• Use sterilized tweezers
to pull out splinters,
bits of glass, or other
objects you can see.
• Wash the area with
soap and water, apply
a sterile bandage, and
see a doctor.
Being careful when using leathercrafting tools
will help prevent injuries.

.All About Leather
All About Leather
Leather—the tanned skin of an animal—is one of humankind’s
oldest and most serviceable materials. It was in common use
when recorded history began, and it has remained important in
the advance of civilization to the present day. Even now, with
plastics and synthetic fibers in growing use, leather is still vital
in our lives.
The animals that leather comes from may be grouped into two
categories: domestic animals and wild or game animals.
Domestic Animals. The most commonly used leathers come
from domestic or commercially raised animals. Most are
by-products of the meat packing industry. Cows, pigs, and
sheep provide the majority of leather product used today.
Wild or Game Animals. Wild or game animals such as deer,
elk, moose, bison, and kangaroo also provide skins for leather-
working use. Some are raised commercially, but most are taken
in the wild by hunters who must follow federal and state laws
designed to ensure the
animals’ continued
survival. Exotic
animals, including
frogs, fish, turtles,
snakes and other
reptiles, and some
birds, also provide
skins for leather-
working, but their use
is limited because
of their declining
populations, environ-
mental concerns,
and expense.
Leather thick-
ness is measured
in ounces. One
ounce is equal
to 1/64 inch in
thickness. Thus,
a weight of 16
ounces means
the leather is
16/64 inch (or
1/4 inch) thick.
Because the
thickness of
leather varies
throughout the
hide, leathers
usually are
described as
having a range
of thickness, such
as 6 to 7 ounces.


14 LEATHERWORK
All About Leather.
Types and Uses of Leather
Many kinds of leather are available for leatherwork. Each has
its own special qualities and best uses. For instance, the way
leather has been tanned can determine how it is used.
Vegetable tanned leather (leather that has been tanned
with extracts from tree bark) normally is used for items that
call for a stiff, firm leather. It is the only leather that can
be tooled.
Chrome tanned leather (leather that has been tanned
with chemicals that contain chromium salts) normally is used
for items that call for a soft, extremely flexible leather. It
cannot be tooled.
Leather can be purchased in complete hides or skins. One
of the more common leathers, cowhide, normally is sold in
half-skins, called sides. Common types of leather and their uses
are listed here to help you select a leather for a project.
Buffalo—The most common buffalo leather is Asian water
buffalo. It comes in hides up to 40 square feet and features the
bovine properties of cowhide and a coarse grain similar to
pigskin. It is used for shoes, boots, and small leather goods.
Calfskin—This leather is taken
from a young bovine in sides or
whole hide up to 18 square feet.
Is has a very tight grain and fine
texture. Calfskin is used for shoes,
boots, and fine leather goods.
Cowhide—The most common
and versatile leather. It is usually
tanned in sides of 18 to 24 square
feet. Durable and easy to work
with, cowhide can be up to
16 ounces thick, vegetable or
chrome tanned. It is used for footwear, furniture, car uphol-
stery, saddles, tack, handbags, and belts.
Deerskin—Tanned in whole hides of 7 to 12 square feet, deer-
skin is very soft and stretchy. Its light weight makes it ideal for
gloves, moccasins, or garments.
Goatskin—Tanned in small, thin whole hides, this tough and
durable leather often is finished in bright colors. It is used for
women’s shoes and the tops of cowboy boots.


LEATHERWORK 15
.All About Leather
Kangaroo—Thin and lightweight, but very dura-
ble, kangaroo leather is stronger weight-for-weight
than any other leather. Whole skins average 5 to
7 square feet. Kangaroo is used for soccer shoes
and sport gloves or is cut into thin strips for
lacing and braiding.
Pigskin—Whole hides, 10 to 20 square feet, have
a coarse grain texture and may be embossed with
a texture to hide the grain or sueded and used
as garment or lining leather. It is used for shoe
linings, small leather goods, and garments.
Reptile—Reptile leathers include snake, lizard,
alligator, and crocodile. Available in whole hides
or pieces in a variety of grains and textures,
reptile is used for fancy leather goods, boots,
shoes, belts, wallets, and handbags.
Sheepskin—Lightweight and delicate, the soft tannage makes nice
garment leather. It is often tanned with the wool on as shearling.
Sheepskin is used for coats, seat covers, and saddle lining.
Collecting Leather
Samples
For requirement 2(c), which
asks you to explain five types of
leather to your counselor, you
may want to use this helpful
leather sample label. The
requirement will be more fun if
you collect samples of the five
types of leather, and this label
will help you stay organized as
you gather your samples and
record their descriptions.
You can find leather samples
at craft and leathercraft retail
stores, saddleries, upholsterers,
tanneries, shoe repair shops,
farm and ranch suppliers,
pet stores, and on the internet
(with your parent or guardian’s
permission and assistance).

.Making Articles Out of Leather
Making Articles
Out of Leather
Before you can make articles out of leather, you must set up a
suitable work space and gather the necessary tools. The range
of leatherworking techniques will grow with each step you take
toward completing the project.
Setting Up a Safe Work Space
There are two very important things to consider when setting
up the work space:
1. Make sure the area is well-lit. A good setup is overhead
fluorescent lighting combined with clamp-on, swing-arm
fixtures that can be positioned over the project.
2. Make sure the area is well-ventilated. The dyes, cements,
and finishes that are used in leatherworking may give off
strong, harmful fumes.
You will also need a sturdy table or workbench to be used as a:
1. Design and assembly area
2. Cutting area
3. Carving and stamping area
4. Dyeing, staining, and finishing area
General Leatherworking Tools and Supplies
Become acquainted with these general leatherworking tools.
In some cases, ordinary tools used at home or school may
be substituted.
Tools for Beginning the Project
Pencil, Paper, and Cardboard. Use a pencil and paper to draw
projects as well as any designs for decorating them. Use card-
board to make reusable templates.


18 LEATHERWORK
Making Articles Out of Leather.
Ruler, Straight Edge, or Steel Square. Use these for measur-
ing, pattern and design layout, and for cutting straight lines.
Avoid unpainted steel rulers and squares because they will stain
leather; ones made of aluminum, plastic, or wood work best.
Scratch Awl. Use for marking the
outlines of cutting patterns and
to mark the positions of holes for
snaps, rivets, stitching, and lacing.
Any awl with a sharp point—even
an ice pick—will work. (Be sure to
cover the point with a rubber guard
when not in use.)
Knife and Leather Shears. Use for
cutting leather. A utility knife or box knife
works well for general leatherwork. Using
snap-off blades will ensure a sharp cutting
edge. A craft knife or hobby knife works well
for projects using lighter-weight leather. Leather shears
work well for cutting soft garment leathers but do not
produce as accurate a cut as a sharp knife.
Rubber Cement and White Glue. These are used to prepare
patterns. Either can be used, but rubber cement is easier to
clean up.
Latex Gloves. These protect your hands while applying dyes
and stains.
Cutting Surface. Use a hard rubber or polyethylene (or poly)
board as a surface for all cutting and punching. The board will
protect the work surface and will keep the edges of knives and
punches sharp and undamaged.
Strap Cutter. Use to cut leather into straps of dif-
ferent widths for belts,
dog collars, etc. Straps
may be cut using a knife
and ruler, but using
a strap cutter is
much easier,
especially if you
plan to make a
lot of belts.
Scratch awl and

LEATHERWORK 19
.Making Articles Out of Leather
Tools for Decorating
the Leather
Tracing Film. A reusable plastic
or polyester film that works like
tracing paper. Use it to transfer
sketched designs to leather. Tracing
paper is not recommended because
it is not as durable.
Modeling Tool. Use the pointed
end of this tool to transfer designs
from the tracing film to the leather.
Use the spoon end, which comes
in many shapes and sizes, to shape
and smooth out the leather.
Applicators (Brushes, Wool Daubers). Use to apply dyes,
stains, and finishes to leather projects.
Water Container, Sponge, and Spray Bottle. Use a plastic,
glass, porcelain, or enameled container to hold water for damp-
ening leather before it can be tooled, stamped, or molded.
Never use a metal container for water. Water that is stored in a
metal container will stain leather. Use a clean sponge to apply
the water. A spray bottle also may be used.
Tooling Surface. A very hard, smooth surface is needed for tool-
ing and stamping designs in leather. Marble is ideal, but granite,
slate, countertop material, or pressed hardboard will work. A
surface 1 to 2 inches thick and with a 6- to 12-by-12-inch surface
will provide a good work area that is easy to move when not in
use. A hard rubber cutting mat may be glued to one side of the
stone to lessen the noise made while stamping and protect the
top of the work surface.
Swivel Knife. Use to cut
designs in leather. This
knife gets its name because
the yoke (finger rest),
located on the opposite end
from the blade, swivels.
This swivel action makes
it easy for leatherworkers
to control the movement of
the blade as it cuts through
the surface of the leather.


20 LEATHERWORK
Making Articles Out of Leather.
Metal-Stamping Tools. Use to make decorative impressions in
leather. There are many stamping tools available, and each one
produces a different impression. More complex designs may
take any number of tools, but designs may be created using
only one tool.
Mallet. Use for striking stamping tools, punches, and other tools
used in leatherworking. The mallet head must be made of raw-
hide, polyethylene (poly), or wood, but never metal or rubber.
Striking a metal tool with a metal hammer will damage a tool.
Edge Beveler. Used to bevel, trim, or round off edges of leather
for a neater, more professional look. Available in several sizes;
the smaller the number, the smaller the bevel. A size 2 is best
for general leatherwork.
Tools for Adding Holes, Snaps, and Rivets
Hole Punches. Use to punch holes in leather for hardware and
to punch holes for stitching and lacing. Two types of punches
available are:
1. Single-drive punches, which punch a single hole when
struck with a mallet. (Remember to use a rubber or poly
cutting board under the leather when punching holes with a
single-drive punch.)
2. Pliers-type punches, which punch a single hole when
squeezed like a pair of pliers. Pliers-type punches are offered
with a single-size tube (punch) or with up to six different
sized tubes mounted on a rotating wheel.
Setters. Use for setting snaps
and rivets in leather articles
such as belts, pouches, sheaths,
and other projects.


LEATHERWORK 21
.Making Articles Out of Leather
Make an ID Tag
A good first leatherworking project is an identification tag. As
you move through the steps necessary to create the tag, you
will learn many techniques used to make articles out of leather.
Pattern Layout and Transferring
To save time and leather, make a cutting
pattern or template of the article you
plan to make. This is simply a cardboard
replica of the actual article, in this case,
an ID tag.
Step 1—Begin by drawing on paper
an article-sized pattern for each of the
parts needed to make the tag. Mark the
positions for all holes, slits, and the ID
window cut-out.
Step 2—When you are satisfied that the
patterns are correct, make a cardboard
template of each part. To make the card-
board template, glue the paper pattern
of each part onto cardboard with rubber
cement or paper glue. (The cardboard back
of a writing tablet works well for this.)
Step 3—Carefully cut out each part of
the cardboard using the paper patterns
as a guide.
Materials Needed
■■ General leatherworking
tools and supplies (See the
beginning of this chapter.)
■■ Scrap pieces of leather
(for practice before using
best leather)
■■ One 4- to 5-ounce piece
of vegetable-tanned

Cutting the Leather
With the templates completed, you
are now ready to cut the leather.
Step 1—Place the leather on the
cutting surface with the fuzzy
(flesh) side down. The smooth
(grain) side of the leather should
always be face-up for cutting.
Step 2—Position the templates
on the leather so there will be
little or no waste.
Step 3—Hold each template firmly and draw its outline into
the leather with a scratch awl. The awl should leave a light
impression in the leather. Make sure to mark all positions for
holes, slot, slits, and the ID window.
Step 4—Carefully cut out each part with a leather knife. Try to
cut through the leather with a single stroke; the cut edge of the
leather will be cleaner and neater if you don’t have to go over it
again. Use a ruler as a guide for the knife on straight cuts.
Punching Holes
The next step after cutting out all the pieces is to punch holes
to be used in stitching the project together, along with any slots
or holes to be used for fasteners.
Step 1—Use a 1/16-inch hole punch to punch all stitching holes
marked on the pattern. Note: The leather should always be dry
when punching holes.
Step 2—To create the slot for the
strap, use a 1/8-inch hole punch
to make a hole in each end of the
slot position. Then use a knife
to cut out the leather in between
the holes to create the slot. Note:
Remember to use a rubber or
poly board under the leather
when using drive punches. Hold
the drive punch straight up and
down and strike it firmly with a
mallet, driving the punch through
the leather.

Making Articles Out of Leather.
Decorating the Leather
Decorating leather by hand
is one of the oldest and
most fascinating arts known.
The term carving refers to
a design in leather that is
first carved with a swivel
knife, then various stamping
tools are used to give
the carved design a three-
dimensional look.
The term stamping
usually refers to a design
in leather that is produced
by using only stamping
tools and a mallet.
PREPARING THE LEATHER
Before you can transfer, then
carve, or stamp a design on
leather, you must moisten
the leather. A sharp swivel knife blade will cut easily and
smoothly and stamping tools will imprint clearly and firmly
into the leather only when the leather has been moistened
(cased) to the proper degree. Knowing how moist a piece of
leather needs to be to reach this degree comes with practice
and personal preference.
Step 1—Wet the leather by casing it—simply rub a damp
sponge on the flesh side of the leather as evenly as possible.
Then turn the leather over and dampen the grain side
(carving surface).
Step 2—When the dampened grain side of the leather has
almost returned to its original color, it is ready to carve.
Another test to know if leather is ready for carving is to hold
the piece against your cheek. If it is dry, it will feel warm. If it
is damp, it will feel cool. That is when the leather is ready to
be carved. With practice, you will know instinctively when to
begin carving.
Step 3—If some areas begin to dry, wipe the sponge over these
areas to keep them damp enough to carve. If the leather is too
dry, it will be too hard for you to cut with the swivel knife. If
the leather is too wet, the cuts will not remain open.
Note: Always use
glass, plastic,
porcelain, or
enameled con-
tainers for water.
Never use metal
containers. The
slightest contact
with metal will
produce dark
stains on leather.

Stamped design


LEATHERWORK 25
.Making Articles Out of Leather
Transferring the Design
Step 1—Whether you choose to carve or stamp the leather, it
is easier if you first draw the main outlines of the design onto
tracing film.
Step 2—When the surface of the dampened leather begins to
return to its original color, it is time to transfer the design to
the leather.
Step 3—Place the tracing film in position on the leather.
Carefully trace over the lines with a stylus. Use no more
pressure than you would for writing with a pencil on paper.
The pressure of the stylus pressing on the tracing film will leave
an impression of the line on the leather. Before removing the
film, lift up one corner to make sure all the lines of the design
have been transferred.
If you must leave the dampened leather for an hour or
longer, preserve its moisture content by putting it into
a plastic food bag. If any drying spots have appeared,
apply moisture lightly with a sponge before storage. To
prevent mildew from forming, store the covered leather
in the refrigerator until you are ready to work again.

Carving the Leather
It’s now time to bring the design to life by carving and
stamping with various tools. To help ensure success, read
this chapter carefully, follow the instructions, and practice
on pieces of scrap leather.
SWIVEL KNIFE
The most important tool used in carving leather is the swivel
knife. It is used to cut the main outline of the design and put
decorative cuts in the finished piece. Study the illustrations
shown here and practice
making some cuts
on scrap leather
before starting
on the project.
Keep the side of your
hand on the work surface
to steady the cut.
The thickness of the lines in
the illustration shown here
indicates the point of the most
pressure applied to the blade.

CAMOUFLAGE
The camouflage is used next. It is designed to add texture
to certain parts of the design. Practice first holding the
camouflage tool straight up and down, striking it sharply
with the mallet. Try leaning it to one side or the other to
vary the impressions. Study the illustration to learn the
proper use of camouflage.
FULL IMPRESSION
This is a full
impression of the
stamp. Hold the
tool straight up
and down, then
strike it sharply
with the mallet so
that all the lines
are equal in depth.
LEFT-CORNER
IMPRESSION
Lean the tool to the
left. Hold the tool
securely so that it
does not slip when
struck with the
mallet. Impressions
on the right side
should appear to
fade to nothing.
RIGHT-CORNER
IMPRESSION
Leaning the tool
to the right fades
the left-corner
impressions and
firmly imprints the
right corner of the
tool. Hold the tool
firmly to keep it
from slipping.
TOE IMPRESSION
Here the tool is
tipped forward on
the toe so that the
corners do not dig
in. The tool usually
is tapped lightly in
this position.

PEAR SHADER
The pear shader is used to shape the areas outlined by the
swivel knife. It creates low spots and high spots for a more
natural look to the design. Hold it straight up and down, and
practice “walking” the pear shader. Think of it as a jackham-
mer, and use short, even strokes as you move the tool just
slightly as you go. Study the photo to learn what areas are
shaded by this pear-shaped tool.
Lessen the force
of blows as the
area to be shaded
diminishes.
Follow the
contours of
the design

shading.
The shader
usually is held
perpendicular
to the leather.

BEVELER
The beveler is another “walking” tool, used to lower the areas
around the design so that the design appears raised. Areas
within the design are also beveled to create an overlapping
effect from one part of the design to another. The toe of
the beveler follows the lines made by the swivel knife. Study
the photo to see how proper beveling brings the design into
bold relief. Practice on scrap leather to get the feel of
“walking” the beveler.

VEINER
The veiner is used to add veins to leaves and for other special
effects. Like the camouflage, the veiner is often leaned to one
side or the other. The angle of the tool determines the length of
the impression and makes it fade out as it goes away from the
swivel cut. Study the illustrations to see how this tool is used.

SEEDER
The seeder is used for making seed pods in the
flower center. This tool is much smaller than the
others, and it doesn’t take nearly as much force to
make a deep impression in the leather. The outer
row of seeds is stamped first, then the second row,
and so on until the pod area is filled.
Fill in the remaining
area. Stamp seeds
carefully. Only the
serrated edges
should touch or
overlap. Optional:
Place a seed in the
center of the scroll.
Stamp the second row
of seeds, stacking them
close to the first row and
keeping them as even as
possible. Do not overlap.
Begin stamping the outer row of
seeds first. Stay within the cut
line, and space the impressions as
close together as a string of beads.
Near the end of a row, adjust the
spacing so that the last seed does
not overlap the flower petal.

BACKGROUNDER
The backgrounder pushes down the background within and

up and down and try to make each impression the same depth.
Rotate the tool with your fingers as you go to avoid creating a
tool pattern. Notice in the photo how even the background

DECORATIVE CUTS
The photo here shows the completed tooling with the addition
of decorative cuts. These are done with the swivel knife and
should always flow in the direction of the design. It takes lots
of practice to do these well. So, practice, practice, practice! It’s
best to practice on pieces of scrap leather before applying
decorative cuts to your actual project.
When adding decorative cuts, make the long cuts first. Practice rights and lefts, first
for motion and flow to get the feel of decorative cutting. Then, practice control to
make the cuts successively shorter and to make them gracefully graduate toward
each other at the ends of each cut.

Stamping the Leather
Many beautiful designs can be
created without the use of a
swivel knife.
ADD A BORDER
A single camouflage stamping
tool can be used to add an
attractive border. To do this:
Step 1—Draw a guideline into the dampened ID tag leather with
the pointed end of a modeling tool or wing divider. Make this
guideline approximately 3/8" in from the edges, as shown here.
Step 2—Set the camouflage tool on the guideline. Hold the tool
straight up and down, then strike it firmly with a mallet. Move
the tool over to the next position and strike again. Repeat this
all the way around the tag. Adjust the distance between the
impressions so the corners will work out evenly.

Dyes, Stains, and Finishes
Leather projects may be left in their
beautiful natural state with only a clear
finish added for protection. You may
want to enhance the design or change the
natural color of the leather by adding dye
or stains.
APPLYING SPIRIT DYES
Spirit dyes usually have an alcohol base,
which requires extra safety precautions dur-
ing use. Never leave spirit dyes within reach
of children. Always close the cap between applications to prevent
spills. Wear latex gloves to protect hands from direct contact with
oil and dyes, as stains are difficult to remove from the skin.
To apply a dye in a solid color:
Step 1—Dip the applicator in the dye and begin in the upper
left-hand corner. Move quickly in a circular motion so that each
stroke lightly overlaps the last, as shown.
Step 2—When the strokes of color begin to thin, dip the appli-
cator into the dye and resume the overlapping circular motion
until the entire project has been covered.
Step 3—One application of dye usually is not enough. Apply
a second “coat” of dye over the entire project in the opposite
direction, repeating steps 1 and 2.
Repeat steps 1 through 3 as needed to achieve the results you want.
The same three steps can be used to apply water-based dyes.
Dyeing the Background. Dyes can be used for coloring the
background of leather projects. Use a No. 3 sable brush, and
leathercraft dye thinner to clean the brush. First, practice on
scrap leather. “Twist” the brush clockwise to point the bristles,
an important technique when applying spirit dyes.
Dip your brush in the dye. Always touch the brush to a
piece of scrap leather first to remove excess dye. Too much dye
will bleed over the edges of the design. Begin by applying the
dye in an open area, toward the center of the background. This
will help prevent bleeding, as well. Use short, pulling strokes.
When most of the dye on the brush has been exhausted,
twist the brush clockwise on a piece of scrap leather, and com-
plete the dyeing using an outward stroke in an open area.
In difficult areas, turn the leather as often as necessary to
help facilitate the dyeing.
Dyes should be applied with
brushes for small areas and with
wool daubers for larger areas.
Before using
dyes, stains, or
finishes, protect
the work surface
by covering it
with brown paper.
Wear latex gloves
to protect hands
from direct
contact with oil
and spirit solvent
dyes, as stains
are difficult to
remove from skin.


LEATHERWORK 39
.Making Articles Out of Leather
APPLYING ANTIQUE STAINS
The purpose of antique staining is to achieve a rustic, antique
color tone while letting the grain of the leather show through.
Antique stains are thicker than spirit dyes and should be
applied heavily over the entire piece.
Step 1—Using a damp sponge, apply a liberal coat of antique
stain, rubbing in a circular motion until the color is even and
all cuts and stamped impressions are filled.
Step 2—Allow the stain to dry 5 to 10 minutes or until set.
Note: Do not allow antique stains to dry more than 15 minutes.
Step 3—Using a clean, damp sponge, remove the excess
stain from the surface of the leather, until the desired contrast
is achieved.
Step 4—After the stain dries, buff the surface of the project
with a soft, clean cloth.
Step 5—To protect the antiqued surface of the project,
apply a finish.
Correct method: Here the brush was pushed to
the center of the background first, minimizing
the danger of dye bleeding over the design.
Incorrect method: Here dyeing was started in a
small area. Excess dye has spread and crawled
over the edges of the design.
The difference
between a dye
and a stain
is that a dye
generally is used
to completely
cover portions
of a project with
color, while a
stain is used to
create highlights
on the entire
stamped or tooled
project. Stain
is also usually
applied copiously,
and the excess is
wiped off with dry
paper towel.

APPLYING FINISHES
Natural leather requires a finish or conditioner to protect it
from water and dirt and to give it an attractive shine. Some
finishes are water-based, some are lacquer, and some are oil- or
fat-based. Your choice will depend partly on what type of dye,
if any, you used on the leather. Ask a leathercraft dealer for
advice on this area, or follow the directions on the dye bottle.
Before applying the finish, there are several points that you
should know:
• All tooling of the design must be complete before finish
is applied.
• The surface area must be clean, dry, and free of any dirt,
dust, or other matter.
• Leather finish must be applied prior to assembly. It is
difficult to get a smooth, even coat over a curved
structural surface.
To apply a leather finish, follow these steps:
Step 1—Press a sponge dampened slightly with
water to the top of a bottle of leather finish, and tip
the bottle so a little finish flows onto the sponge.
Step 2—Apply a light coat of finish to the carved
side of the leather, moving the sponge in a circular
motion over the leather. Work the finish into the
cuts and impressions.
Step 3—Let the finish dry thoroughly, then apply a second coat
if you desire a shinier finish. Allow the piece to dry thoroughly.
Step 4—If a high gloss is desired, buff the leather with a piece
of woolskin or a clean, soft, lint-free cloth.
The project is now ready to be assembled,
either by stitching with waxed thread or
by lacing with leather or plastic lace.
Assembly by Lacing or Stitching
There are many ways to lace together a
project and many different materials that
can be used for a variety of effects.
Lacing. The most popular lace is
3/32-inch calf lace. It is easy to work with,
extremely durable, and attractive. Lacing
Lacing makes this ID tag much more
attractive. A hand-stitched tag appears
at the beginning of this project.


LEATHERWORK 41
.Making Articles Out of Leather
techniques include the whip stitch, running stitch,
and double-loop lacing.
Hand-stitching. Many leathercrafters prefer
to assemble their projects with waxed thread.
Techniques include single- and double-needle
hand-stitching.
To prepare the project for lacing or stitching,
follow these steps:
Step 1—Cement the flesh (rough) side of the
front pieces to the flesh side of the back piece,
lining up the edges and holes. Be careful not to
cement the top, unpunched area of the pieces
so the ID card can be inserted and removed.
Step 2—Insert a 2-by-4-inch piece of plastic and an ID card
into the tag so the information on the card shows through the
window in the front.
Step 3—Push one end of the strap through the slots in the ID
tag, then thread the end through the slit in the strap and pull
snug to secure.
Step 4—Attach the tag to the handle of suitcase, duffel bag,
or backpack by looping the loose end of the strap around the
handle. Then push the tag through the slit in the strap and pull
snug to secure.
Align the front and back pieces
prior to lacing or stitching.

SINGLE-NEEDLE HAND-STITCHING
Step 1—Thread one end of waxed thread through
the eye of the needle and pull about 1 inch
through. Wrap the end around the thread and
twist it between your fingers. Push the needle
through first hole in the top piece only, leaving
a 1-inch tail of thread between pieces of leather.
Stitch down through the second hole in both
pieces of leather and up through the third hole.
Continue stitching in this manner to the last hole,
pulling each stitch tight.
Step 2A—When you reach the last hole, turn and
begin stitching back to the starting point, filling in
alternate stitches. Stitch to the beginning hole.
Step 2B—Optional, for a more professional look
when filling in the stitches: From one side, put
the needle through the hole above the previously
stitched thread. From the other side, put the needle
through the hole below the previously stitched
thread and pull each stitch tight. Continue stitching
in this manner.
Step 3A—When you reach the beginning hole, go
through the hole in the bottom piece only and bring
the needle up between the two pieces of leather.
Trim the excess thread. Tap down the stitches with
a mallet.
Step 3B—Alternate ending: When you reach
the beginning hole, go through the hole in both
pieces of leather and then stitch back through the
next three holes and pull each stitch tight. Trim the
excess thread close to the leather on the outside,
and tap down the stitches with a mallet.


LEATHERWORK 49

DOUBLE-NEEDLE HAND-STITCHING
Step 1—Thread one end of waxed thread and pull
1 inch through. Wrap the end around the thread and
twist it between your fingers. Place a needle on the
other end of the thread in the same way. Push one
needle through one set of aligned holes on the side
of project and pull it through until the same count
of thread is on each side.
Step 2—Holding the project between your knees,
push the needle on the inside through the next hole
and pull through. Push the outside needle through
the same hole, being sure to go over the first thread.
Grasp both threads and pull the stitch tight. Continue
stitching this way all around the project, pulling
each stitch tight.
Step 3—When you reach the last hole, stitch back
through the preceding three holes, pulling each
stitch tight. Trim the excess thread close to the
leather on the outside and tap down the stitches
with a mallet.

Dressing the Project
You can improve the look
and feel of projects by
dressing or finishing
the edges.
Step 1—Bevel or round
off the edges of the project
with an edge beveler. A
size 2 edge beveler works
the best on projects made
out of 4- to 9-ounce (4/64-
inch to 9/64-inch) leather,
including belts.
Step 2—Once you have rounded the edges of the project with
an edge beveler, use a sponge to slightly dampen the edges
with water.
Step 3—Burnish or slick all rounded edges by rubbing the
edges back and forth briskly with a folded piece of canvas or
coarse cloth. A properly dressed edge should have a darkened,
polished look.

Make a Belt
The belt project will
use the following
techniques:
• Sizing
• Cutting
• Punching holes
and slots
• Dressing edges
• Setting snaps
Determining Waist Size
The first step in making a belt is to determine the waist size.
Use one of two methods.
Method 1. Pull a measuring tape snugly over pants around
waist, outside the belt loops. Do not pull the tape too tight.
Method 2. Lay an old belt on a work surface as straight as
possible. Measure from the end of the buckle tongue to the
hole most used.
Getting Started
Step 1—Cut or buy a strip of leather
of the desired width that is 8 to
10 inches longer than the waist size.
On the back side, measure back
21
⁄2 inches from the buckle end and
mark a fold line on the leather.
Step 2—Place the buckle with the
bar at the fold line. Begin from the
tip of the buckle tongue and measure
the waist line. Mark the end of the
waist size. This will be the center
hole of the billet end.

Step 3—Mark, then punch, a slot for
the buckle tongue and holes for the
belt snaps.
Step 4—Mark, then punch holes for,
the billet end of the belt. Trim the billet
end of the belt to a point.
Step 5—Dress the edges of the belt.
Step 6—Attach belt snaps to the buckle
end of the belt.
Step 7—Stamp and/or carve a design on the belt. If a name is
to be stamped or carved, center it halfway between the tip of
the buckle tongue and the center hole in the billet end.
Note: The buckle end of the belt should face to the left when
laid flat and stamping a name.
Step 8—Apply a dye or stain (if desired) and a leather finish.
Step 9—Attach the buckle to the buckle end of the belt
to complete.
Making a Belt Keeper
Step 1—Cut a 6- to 7-inch long by 3

strip of 4- to 5-ounce tooling leather. Fold the
strip around two thicknesses of the belt. Trim the
excess leather.
Step 2—Dress the edges, then stitch or staple the
ends of the keeper together. Color it to match the
belt, then apply a leather finish. Slide the keeper
in place between the folded buckle end of the belt
and fasten the snaps to secure.

Assembling the Knife Pouch
Before starting assembly, set the stud and eyelet
part of the line 24 snap in the snap hole punched
in the front part of the knife pouch. Set the cap
and socket parts of the snap in the snap hole
punched in the flap portion of the back part.
Step 1—To attach the belt loop, put the grain
(smooth) sides of the belt loop and back/flap parts
together, aligning the holes in one end of the loop
with the top set of holes in the back part.
Step 2—Mentally number the holes 1 through 6.
With half a yard of waxed thread, come up through
hole 1 to the top side of the leather, leaving about
3-inches of thread on the underside. Then go down
through hole 2, back up through 3, down through
4, up through 5, and down through 6.
Step 3—From hole 6, come up through hole 1.
Go down through 6, up through 5, down through
4, up through 3, and down through 2. Tie the
thread ends in a knot to secure. Tap the knot flat
with a mallet.

Step 4—Fold the belt loop part back and align
the holes in the other end of the loop to the bot-
tom set of holes in the back part, with the flesh
(rough) side of the strap on the grain side of the
back part. Stitch on the belt loop as explained in
steps 1 and 2.
Note: Before stitching the knife pouch together,
lightly dampen the flesh side of the front part with
water. This will make it easier to form the front
part to the back part. Stitch the pieces together
while the leather is still damp.
Step 5—To stitch the front part to the back part,
push the needle and 11/2 yards of thread through
the first hole in the back part, leaving 3 inches of
thread at the end to tie off. Go through the second
hole, then back through the first hole, then back
through the second hole. Continue stitching in
and out around the pouch.
Step 6—There will be a notch between holes 17
and 18. Go through these holes twice, pulling the
stitches tight to close up the notch and even the
edges of the front and back parts. Repeat for the
notch between holes 25 and 26.
Step 7—Optional: If you want to add the flash-
light holder, stop stitching when you reach the
fourth hole past the second notch. In the bottom
of the pouch, fold the hole-punched edges of the
holder together, forming a loop. Sandwich the
front and back parts of the pouch between the
edges of the holder so the first holes in the bottom
of the holder line up with the fourth hole past
the second notch in the pouch. Continue stitch-
ing through all four layers of leather, securing the
holder to the side of the pouch.
Step 8—When you have stitched completely
around the pouch, stitch through the last two
holes twice. Then, stitch back around the pouch,
filling in alternate stitches. When you reach the
beginning stitch, tie the ends of thread in a knot
on the back side of the pouch. Trim the excess
thread, then tap the knot flat with a mallet.

Getting Started
Step 1—Trace the cutting pattern for the fringe
on the fringe piece, and mark where the holes will
be punched. Then, cut the fringe and punch the
holes (using the 1/16-inch hole punch) on the leather
according to the pattern.
Step 2—Put the two pouch pieces together with the
wrong side out and the right (finished) side in. Before
stitching, center the fringe piece toward the inside,
between the front and back pieces of the pouch.
Step 3—Leaving a tail of 4 inches as you thread
through the first hole, sew around the pouch in a
running stitch. Make two stitches and then pull snug.
Continue sewing all the way around the three sides,
pulling the stitches snug as you go, leaving the top of
the pouch open. Be sure to sew through the fringe at
the bottom of the pouch.
Step 4—At the last stitch, turn the pouch over
and, using the same running stitch, sew back to the
starting point by filling in the opposite side of the
first stitches.
Step 5—Pull the last stitches tight and tie the ends
together in a square knot.

Braiding
Another popular type of leather crafting involves the braiding
technique. Once you master this technique, you can make
all kinds of things, including the lanyard described in the
following steps.
Tips on Braiding
• Pull all strands tight.
This will make the braid
neat and uniform.
• If you must lay aside an
unfinished braid, put paper
clips on the loose strands
or tie them in place with an
overhand knot.
• Avoid twisting strands.
They should lie flat and
follow the circular contour
of the braid.
• This table shows the
lengths of lace necessary
for braiding:
For the Round Braid
• Two strands of lace, each
3 feet long, will make
1 foot braided.
• Two strands of lace, each
6 feet long, will make
2 feet braided.
• Two strands of lace, each
9 feet long, will make 3
feet braided.
For the Square and
Spiral Braids
• Two strands of lace, each
3 feet long, will make
4 inches braided.
• Two strands of lace, each
6 feet long, will make
8 inches braided.
• Two strands of lace, each
9 feet long, will make
12 inches braided.

Make the Mystery Braid Wristband or Belt
The mystery braid is a fun and fascinating technique that gives
your wristband or belt an interesting effect.
Making the Mystery Braid Wristband
Step 1—Measure around your wrist and add 3 inches.
This is the length of leather you will need for a
11
⁄8-inch-wide wristband.
Step 2—Punch the snap holes, trim the ends, and cut two even
slits as shown in the illustration (forming three equal strands).
Step 3—Set the snaps as shown in the illustration. Note:
When setting the snap, remember that the rounded end of the
band will snap over the squared end.
Step 4—Decorate as desired, apply the edge dressing, and then
the leather finish.
Belt
Materials Needed
■■ General leatherworking tools and supplies
(See the beginning of this chapter.)
■■ A length of 4- to 5-ounce leather (vegetable-
tanned cowhide, suede, latigo, etc.), 11/8 inches
wide for the wristband and wider for the belt
■■ Belt, glove, or line 20 snap
■■ 1/2-inch hole punch and snap setter
For some projects that involve braiding, a light-
weight kernmantle rope called paracord can be
substituted. Made of nylon, paracord comes in
a wide variety of colors. It can be fun to use for
a project like the lanyard.

Leather vs. Synthetics
We have many choices when it comes to selecting the materials we use
every day to make our lives easier. Hiking boots, backpacks, and many
other products can be made from either leather or synthetic materials like
nylon, plastic, vinyl, or rubber. Here are a few points to consider.
• Leather is easier to work with than synthetics, and can be personalized
with tooling, dyeing, and other techniques. Designs and color can be
added to synthetics only during the manufacturing process.
• Leather is easy to cut, punch, and sew with hand tools, while synthet-
ics are usually molded or preformed where the final product is made.
• Leather “breathes”—it allows heat and sweat to release through the
material. A solid vinyl material will repel water from the outside but it
traps heat on the inside, making you uncomfortable in warm weather.
However, to repel rain and snow, rubber may be a better choice.
• When it comes to shoes, nothing fits or wears like leather. Leather
uppers are strong, flexible, and will mold to your feet. For protection,
the soles will be made of rubber to give you secure footing.
• Leather goods will probably last longer than synthetic materials and
will probably be less expensive in the long run.
• For a backpack, leather may be very durable but will likely be much
heavier and more expensive than one made from nylon. Leather for
upholstery and furniture is more expensive than fabric but it will prob-
ably last longer and not absorb spills and stains like a woven fabric.

Making the Mystery Braid Belt
Step 1—Cut a belt strip as explained in “Make a Belt” earlier in
this chapter, but add approximately 1 inch to the length of the
waist for every 12-inch section to be braided. So, for a 24-inch
braided section, add 2 inches to the length of the leather you
will need.
Step 2—Cut two even slits (forming three 1/2-inch-wide strands
for a typical 11/2-inch-wide belt) in the belt strip, as shown.
Remember to leave plenty of room at both ends of the belt strip
for the buckle tongue slot, snap holes, and billet holes. Note:
So that the size can be adjusted if necessary, do not mark or
punch the holes until after the belt has been braided.
Step 3—Trim the billet end to a point. Do all decorating and
edge dressing, then apply a leather finish.
Step 4—Follow the instructions for mystery braiding later in
this chapter.
Step 5—Lay the braided belt strip out flat and remeasure to
establish the correct waist size. Mark, then punch the buckle
tongue slot, snap holes, and billet holes. Attach a belt keeper, if
desired, and a buckle to complete the project.

How to Do the Mystery Braid
Use these instructions for both the wristband and the belt.
Step 1—Hold the strip with the rounded end at the top and the
flat end at the bottom (see figure 1).
Step 2—Bring the bottom end of the strip up between strands
2 and 3 (see figure 2), and adjust and push the resulting twist
to the bottom.
Step 3—Bring the bottom end of the strip up again, then pass
strand 1 over 2, then 3 over 1, and 2 over 3. Pass the bottom
end of the strip between strands 2 and 3 (see figure 3). Adjust
and work the braid up to the top of the strip. This completes the
first braid cycle.
Step 4—To complete a second braid cycle, pass the bottom
end of the strip between strands 2 and 3 (see the dashed arrow
in figure 4). As in step 3, pass strand 1 over 2, 3 over 1, and 2
over 3, then pass the bottom end of the strip between strands 2
and 3. Straighten the braids. This completes two braid cycles.
To continue braiding more cycles, follow step 3 until the strands
are too short to complete another full cycle. Adjust the strands
so that all the braids are even.

.Leather Care
Leather Care
Leather is one of nature’s most durable materials. Modern
tanning methods contribute to its natural durability by adding
oils, waxes, and other ingredients that soften and help preserve
the leather.
Leather that has been neglected will feel dry and stiff to
the touch. This is because oils in the leather have dried. To
restore the leather, these oils must be replaced. Excessive heat
will irreversibly harden leather. Avoid excessive heat, such as
leaving leather in a car in the hot sun.


78 LEATHERWORK
Leather Care.
Cleaning and Reconditioning
Clean leather before applying a reconditioner (or conditioner):
Step 1—Use a brush to remove any loose dirt.
Step 2—Clean the leather thoroughly with saddle soap or
other leather cleaner, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Step 3—Allow the leather to dry completely
before reconditioning.
Many good conditioners are available, including mink and
neat’s-foot oils. Work the conditioner into the leather until
the softness and pliability returns. Most of these substances
will darken the leather, which in most cases will enhance the
leather’s appearance.

Caring for Leather Goods
Normal weather conditions and use can have harmful effects
on leather items if they do not receive proper care. Be sure to
follow these tips after using leather items.
Outdoor Gear. For items such as hiking boots, baseball gloves,
and saddle tack, reconditioning usually is sufficient to give
some degree of water resistance. Water-repellent coatings for
leather are available if necessary.
Dress Shoes. Using oil-type conditioners will make the shoes
impossible to shine. Instead of oil, apply a good quality shoe
polish after cleaning the leather. Allow the polish to dry, then
buff to a high gloss with a shoe brush or soft cloth.
Suede Articles. Suede should be cleaned and reconditioned
with products specifically made for use on suede. Using prod-
ucts intended for smooth leathers on suede may damage the
suede’s fuzzy surface texture.
Fine Leathers.
Leave the cleaning
and reconditioning
of fine leather articles,
such as furniture
and clothing, to
trained professionals.





LEATHERWORK 81
.Leather Tanning
Leather Tanning
Tanning is the process of converting the hide or skin of an
animal into leather. The two most popular ways of doing this
are vegetable tanning and mineral or chrome tanning.
Vegetable Tanning
The basic element used is tannic acid, derived from the bark or
leaves of certain trees, shrubs, or other plants. Only vegetable-
tanned leather will retain the designs made by carving or
stamping. It may also be molded into almost any shape after
being dampened with water, and it will hold that shape
after it dries.
Mineral or Chrome Tanning
The basic element used is potassium bichromate. Leather that
has been chrome tanned is normally soft to the touch, pliable,
and somewhat water-repellent. This makes it unsuitable to be
carved or stamped. Cut edges of this leather may appear bluish
green, a color left by minerals used in the tanning process.
Leather tanned by this method is made into clothing, furniture,
automobile upholstery, and many other items that call for a
soft, durable leather.
The Tannery Operation
When hides arrive at the tanner, they are temporarily preserved
by salting like beef jerky or by drying to prevent rotting. When
the hides are needed, they are first washed to rehydrate and to
remove any salt.
Then comes dehairing. After soaking in a large vat of
limewater to loosen the hairs and a thorough rinsing, the hides
are ready for tanning. If they are dried at this point, they make
rawhide, such as is used in a rawhide mallet or dog bones.


82 LEATHERWORK
Leather Tanning.
Tanning, the next step, is where the hide collagen is chemi-
cally converted from rawhide into leather, which can then be
dried and used without being too stiff and without rotting. Both
these operations require careful control of chemicals.
Tanning has been done historically in vats in the ground
using vegetable-tanning materials. This step used to take up to
a year, but is done in modern times in about a month. Modern
chrome tanning, developed only in the late 1800s, is performed
in large rotating drums in a day’s time.
After the tanning, the leather is washed and dyed if needed.
Then the oils—“fat liquors”—are worked into the leather,
depending on its intended use. A tooling leather will have a
small amount of light oil so it may be carved and stamped;
harness leather will have a great deal of heavy tallow to make it
waterproof. The leather is then wrung (hand-wringing is still the
best method), and laid smooth either by hand rubbing or on a
setting-out machine. Lastly, the leather is allowed to dry.
Many modern leathers are finished by sanding then paint-
ing the surface. This type of leather goes into shoes, car seats,
and shiny clothes. Many other leathers, such as tooling and
saddle leathers, retain the original beauty of their grain surface.
Look closely, and you will see a scar or a wrinkle just as you
see on your own skin.
Remember to take care of your leather as you would your
skin, by washing it if it gets too dirty, and by giving it a little
oil (but not too much) every now and again. Leather will last
forever if you take good care of it.
How to Tan the Skin of a Small Animal
The skins of small animals may be tanned or cured success-
fully by Scouts, but amateurs should never destroy animals
for this purpose. It takes an expert to handle valuable furs.
Furthermore, it would be contrary to the spirit of Scouting to
hunt harmless animals merely to obtain a few skins.
Small wild animal skins suitable for tanning are rabbits,
squirrels, prairie dogs, and groundhogs. You can obtain such
skins from slaughterhouses, farmers, or ranchers. Skins occa-
sionally are available from dealers in furs and hides or from
farmers and others who trap predatory animals. During the
hunting season, Scout troops that want to undertake larger tan-
ning or leatherwork projects may be able to obtain the skins of
some larger animals such as deer or elk from hunters.


LEATHERWORK 83
.Leather Tanning
Curing a Skin
Curing is the process of completely drying a skin; the hair is
not removed.
Step 1—The first step is to clean off any flesh or fatty particles
that remain after the animal is skinned.
Step 2—Draw the skin over a board, flesh side out. The board
should be big enough so that the skin can be kept stretched to
its original size while drying.
Step 3—Rub salt into the skin to absorb the moisture. Pay
particular attention to the edges; the salt will prevent flies from
laying eggs in the outer edges.
Step 4—Drying is best done in the open air in the shade. Avoid
fire and the heat of the sun; freezing may cause the skin to
crack. A uniform temperature is best. It may be necessary to
keep the skin indoors in rainy or very hot or cold weather.
The time it takes for the skin to dry completely will vary
according to the weather and size of the skin. During the
drying process, additional salt should be applied occasionally
to help absorb the moisture. The skin may be tacked to a floor,
a wall, or an inclined board. Store dry hides in a cool place
until ready to tan.
Dehairing a Skin
The first step in tanning is to remove the hair from a skin. This
may be done with a limewater solution.
Step 1—If the skin has been cured or dried, soak it with water
to soften before putting it in the solution.
Step 2—Make a milk-of-lime solution by mixing 2 pounds,
about 1 cup at a time, of unslaked lime into 1 gallon of water.
Stir the mixture carefully, adding small quantities of lime at a
time so that it will not boil out or splash on hands or clothing.
The solution can cause burns.


84 LEATHERWORK
Leather Tanning.
Step 3—Handling the skin with sticks or paddles and wear-
ing rubber gloves, immerse the moist skin in the solution. Let
it stand for about an hour, then test at frequent intervals. The
skin is ready when the hair slips.
Step 4—Remove the skin and rinse with at least 1 gallon of
clear water, depending on the size of the skin. Repeat three or
four times.
Step 5—After the hair is loos-
ened and while the skin is still
wet, it should be scraped. One
Scout may hold the skin taut
across a 2-by-4 or nail it to a
workbench. A wide putty knife
or similar blunt-edged tool
makes an effective scraper—
hold it at a slant, and have the
second Scout push or pull the
skin with sufficient pressure to
pull the hair from it in progres-
sive strokes. If it is impossible
to remove all the hair in one
operation, leave the skin soak-
ing in clear water until the
dehairing can be completed.
Step 6—Note that a thin skin still covers the surface. This is
known as a “scarf skin,” and it reveals the characteristic grain
of the leather. Much of the strength of the leather is in this
grain surface, and it must be retained if leather articles are to
be made from it. If a soft or suede finish is desired, this surface
skin is removed by continued scraping while the skin is still
moist. The tanning process should follow immediately. If this
is not possible, the skin must be kept wet overnight. Note:
The hair of a freshly skinned deer hide will slip or loosen
sufficiently to permit scraping after a few hours of soaking
in lukewarm water.


LEATHERWORK 85
.Leather Tanning
Salt-Alum Tanning
The salt-alum process, an old method of fur-skin tanning,
is still widely used. It usually produces skins with stretch
and flexibility.
A salt-alum tanning solution may be made as follows:
Step 1—Dissolve 1 pound of ammonia alum or potash alum
in 1 gallon of water.
Step 2—Dissolve 2 ounces of washing soda (crystallized
sodium carbonate) and 8 ounces of shale in 1/2 gallon of water.
Step 3—When it is dissolved, slowly and constantly pour and
stir the soda-salt solution into the alum solution.
A cleaned and softened skin may be tanned by immersion in
this solution from two to five days, depending upon its thick-
ness. Because of the action of alum on some furs, it may be best
to apply the tanning liquor as a paste to the flesh side only.
Step 4—Mix the tanning liquor with sufficient flour to make a
thin paste. Add the flour in small quantities with a little water
and mix thoroughly to avoid lumps.
Step 5—Tack the skin out smoothly, flesh side up. Apply a
coating of the paste carefully, at intervals of a day, from two to
three coatings, depending upon the thickness of the skin. Only
thick skins should need as many as three treatments. Leave the
last coating on for three to four days.
Step 6—Scrape off the coating and rinse the skin clean in clear
water, putting in about an ounce of borax to a gallon of water.
Finally, rinse in water only.
Step 7—Work the skin over a beam to remove most of the
water, stretch it out flat, and sponge over the flesh side with a
thin sap paste. Let the paste completely soak in, apply a thin
coat of oil, then rinse, stretch into shape, and hang up dry.

An optional requirement for the Leatherwork merit badge is
to visit and report on a leather-related business. Almost every
town in America has a leather-related business available to
tour. Whether it’s a small, custom-leather shop or a large indus-
try (tannery, apparel manufacturer, etc.), it will be exciting to
explore the endless ways leather is used today.
You may be surprised how welcome you will be in these
industries. Most shop or factory managers will be pleased to
give you the “grand tour” and answer questions about their
operation. Try to get an overall understanding of exactly what
takes place; take notes and pictures (but ask first, please).
Touring the Business
Here are some good questions
to ask:
1. What kind of products do they make
or sell?
2. What kinds of leathers do they use?
3. Is the leather hand-tooled, machine-
embossed, sewn, or laced?
4. Who buys the products? Are they
sold directly to the general public or
to other businesses?
5. How many hides of leather are used
each month or year?

leatherwork. Ask to speak to the manager about what leather
items, supplies, and instructional materials they sell. To
locate such a shop, look in your local telephone directory
under the headings “leather” or “crafts.”
• Leather tanneries are located nationwide. Call for an appoint-
ment and a troop tour of the facility. You will be able to see
firsthand the manufacturing of leather from start to finish.
• Saddleries, farm and ranch supply stores, and boot and shoe
repair shops are found everywhere. Many can arrange on-site
demonstrations about leather care, maintenance, and repair.
Managers will be happy to offer helpful techniques.
• Manufacturers of custom leather products (leather-covered
furniture, home furnishings, upholstery) use a variety of
leather, tooling, staining, and finishing techniques in today’s
homes, automobiles, and recreational vehicles.
• Related industries to leatherwork will include makers of
leatherwork tools, dyes, and finishes. Sources can be located
through leathercraft retail stores.
