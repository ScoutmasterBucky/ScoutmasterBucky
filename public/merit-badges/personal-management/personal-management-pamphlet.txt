.Managing Yourself, Managing Your Money
Managing Yourself,
Managing Your Money
As you grow older, you will face an increasing number of
decisions that will affect your future. Although you will
continue to gain advice and direction from your parents or
guardians and teachers, eventually you must be the one to
take responsibility for yourself and your actions. Personal
management is about taking control of your life.
Learning to Manage Yourself
To understand what personal management is about, think of all
the things your parents or other adults do for you as well as
what they do for themselves. Do the adults in your life buy and
prepare your food, provide a place for you to live, buy your
clothes, take you places you want and need to go, and help pay
for many of the other things you do, need, and want? What if it
were up to you to do all of these things? If it were, you would
need to manage your money and time to get things done.
Making more
decisions on your
own can be
both scary and
exciting because
it means that
you will become
responsible
for both
your mistakes
and successes.


10 PERSONAL MANAGEMENT
Managing Yourself, Managing Your Money.
Currently, much of your life probably is managed for you.
Your parents or guardians guide you by suggesting what to do
and the best way to do it, your teachers determine what you
learn in school, and, if you play a sport, your coaches instruct
you. Providing guidance is their way of teaching you the skills
and knowledge you will need to take care of yourself as you
grow older.
Managing your life is similar to planning a journey. It is
often best to have a road map before you begin and to plot a
course that will help you avoid and minimize bumps and
detours along the way. Earning the Personal Management
merit badge will help you learn to manage critical parts of your
life, including your money, your time, and your future. To do
this, you will need to develop self-discipline and persistence.
Mapping a plan for your life will involve setting short-
range and long-range goals and investigating different ways
to reach those goals. Education, training, and experience all
help make your goals become a reality. To achieve your goals,
you will choose the best path and make a commitment to it,
while remaining flexible enough to deal with changes and
new opportunities.
You probably will not be on your own until you move
away from home, but now is a good time to begin preparing
for that day.
Learning to Manage Your Money
No matter how much money you earn, learning to manage
your money is one of the most important things you will need
to understand. This involves planning for career changes and
retirement over your lifetime, considering how finances affect
your family and relationships, and making choices about how
to earn and spend money.
It is not as common as it once was for people to work
for one employer throughout their careers and then receive a
pension from that employer to cover living expenses during
retirement. Instead, you likely will work for several employers
throughout your lifetime, and your long-term financial security
will depend on how well you manage your money during your
working years and into retirement.
Make setting
short- and
long-term goals
a routine during
your adolescence
and through
adulthood. You will
discover how
these goals
change according
to your stage
of life.


.Managing Yourself, Managing Your Money
People today face many choices about how to earn,
save, and spend money. Because few of us have an unlimited
amount of money, among the keys of wisely and effectively
managing money is learning to do without (at least temporarily)
something we want. However, advertising messages urge us to
buy products we often do not need. Effectively managing your
money will require you to resist these messages.
You need to learn money management skills, and it is
never too soon to start. Poor money management habits can
cause family stress and lead to excessive debt and a poor credit
history, which can make it difficult to get home loans, car
loans, and other financial assistance.
You might find that when you want to buy something,
you will need to reduce expenses in other areas. For example
to save for a new backpack, you might need to take your lunch
to school rather than buying food at the cafeteria, or do lower-
cost activities such as streaming movies and going for walks
and hikes—instead of more costly alternatives.
While completing the Personal Management merit badge,
what you learn about earning, saving, investing, borrowing,
and spending money wisely can help eliminate conflicts and
improve your quality of life. You also will learn how to use
your time wisely and organize projects so that they are more
manageable. All of these lessons will help you think about
your long-term goals and your future, and can serve you for
a lifetime.
Money is not, and
should not be,
everything in life,
of course. More
important things
exist, such as your
religion, family,
friends, helping
others, and
achieving personal
growth. However,
money is a major
part of life and can
affect you, your
family’s well-
being, and your
relationships.

12 PERSONAL MANAGEMENT
Being a Smart Shopper.
Being a Smart Shopper
Before they buy, smart shoppers use a wide variety of resources
to help them find out more about the product they want to
purchase. Here are some tips on researching products, reading
advertisements, watching for sales, comparison shopping, and
considering alternatives to help you become a smart shopper.
Research the Item You Want
First, consider the features you need and want. Next, consider
the product’s features and if it meets your criteria. Then you
might be able to find a more affordable product that has only
the features you need and want.
Consider the quality of the product. It might be worth
paying more for a quality product if it will last longer and
perform better. However, a lower-priced product might offer
high quality, too. That is why it is important to read consumer
guides and to check consumer websites for comments and
personal reviews about the product. If the quality is poor and
the product breaks or falls apart in a short time, whatever price
you paid will have been too much.
Consumer buying guides can be handy for research.
These guides provide anything from general details
and purchasing tips to specific information that will
help you narrow your selection. For instance, an eval-
uation of televisions might show a comparison of
prices, screen size, picture quality, sound quality, and
the types of connections that come with the TV. Many
online buying guides might be sponsored by compa-
nies affiliated or aligned with certain brands and
could be biased toward such brands. The most useful
buying guides may be from nonprofit sources like
Consumer Reports magazine.
When you are
considering a
purchase such
as an electronic
device, ask
yourself this
question: “What
does this ‘thing’
do that I cannot
do for myself
with what I
already have?”


PERSONAL MANAGEMENT 13
.Being a Smart Shopper
Before you buy the product, check online reviews and talk
to people you know who might have used it. Did they like it?
Was it worth the price? Try the product, if possible, before
buying. Borrow or rent it from a friend to determine whether
you want to own it. Or, ask a salesperson to demonstrate the
product. When you are ready to buy a car, for example, test
drive it and compare it to other cars.
Look for Sales
Sometimes it is possible to wait until the item you want to buy
goes on sale. If a store is not conducting a sale, the salesperson
might tell you if the item will go on sale soon. Online retailers
and local stores might have annual sales at the same time each
year. Sometimes stores will reimburse the difference if the item
you bought goes on sale within 30 days after you bought it.
Common types of sales include seasonal sales, when stores
phase out summer items to stock fall and winter merchandise,
and vice versa; inventory sales, which occur just before stores
take inventory (count merchandise); promotional sales designed
to introduce new products or spur buying interest when sales
are slow; and situational sales, which often are advertised
as going-out-of-business sales or moving sales.
Try to shop at the beginning of a sale when
a wide selection is still available, and exam-
ine sale items before you buy to make
sure they are not damaged or flawed.
Comparison Shop
Compare prices and gather
additional information about the
item from at least three stores or
other sources. One store or online
retailer might sell the item for less
than another’s advertised sale
price. There are mobile applications
that can scan UPC bar codes to help
you compare prices for many
consumer goods. Also, many local
stores will match the sale prices of other
local stores or online retailers if you ask.
The internet
can be a valuable
resource for
researching a
product in
which you
are interested.


14 PERSONAL MANAGEMENT
Being a Smart Shopper.
Look for discount coupons in newspapers, coupon books,
online, or in the mail. Some items might come with a mail-in
rebate that offers money back.
If you are buying an item that comes in units, such as
ounces or pounds, check the item’s cost per unit. The cost-
per-unit figure allows you to compare the real price difference
between similar or same items of different quantities. Some
grocery stores list the cost per unit on an item’s price tag. A
lower-priced item in a smaller container might actually cost
more per unit than a similar item in a larger quantity and
larger container.
Example: You are comparing a 24-ounce bottle of pancake
syrup for $1.99 (cost per unit = 8 cents per ounce) with a
similar 36-ounce bottle for $2.49 (cost per unit = 7 cents per
ounce). In this case, if everything else is equal, the larger
bottle is the better value because it has a lower cost per unit.
However, be aware that buying a very large container of
something that might not all be used before it spoils (like
mayonnaise) may be unwise.
If there is a problem with the product, return it to
the store or online retailer or contact customer
service promptly. Be sure to keep your receipt. Most
stores want to ensure customer satisfaction and will
offer to replace the product or repair it. Ask to speak
to the manager if the problem is not addressed
to your satisfaction.
Before making a
big purchase,
compare the
manufacturers’
warranties along
with pricing. Many
manufacturers offer
a one-year
guarantee free of
charge with an
option to purchase
additional
coverage. Some
retailers also may
offer extended
warrantee at an
additional cost;
however, unless the
product is
extremely
unreliable, these
tend to be a poor
value for the
consumer.


PERSONAL MANAGEMENT 15
.Being a Smart Shopper
Advertisements
Advertising informs you of available products, their features
and benefits, where they can be bought and at what price.
But advertising is often misleading. Remember: the
purpose of an ad isn’t to inform you of objective facts,
but rather to get you to buy a particular product. If a
product is supposed to be “new and improved,” make
sure you find out what has been improved. The
improvement could be so slight that it might be better
to buy the older model at a cheaper price — or the
“improvement” may in fact not even make the product
better. Also, consider whether the product really delivers
the benefits that advertisements claim. Just because a great
athlete wears a certain brand of shoes does not mean your
athletic skills will improve if you wear the same brand.
Consider Motives of ‘Advice’
Just as advertisements are designed to sell products, many
givers of “advice” are more interested in selling products than
in helping you make good decisions. For example, a personal-
finance magazine that has “The 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Today!”
on the cover isn’t trying to give you good advice about
investing—they’re just trying to get you to buy the magazine.
The company that publishes the magazine makes money in
only two ways: by selling advertisements to other companies
and by selling the magazine to people like you. So just because
you see advice in a magazine or book, online or on TV, or
anywhere else, that doesn’t mean it is good advice.
Likewise, salespeople in a store might be good at giving
advice, but they also owe allegiance to the company they work
for, even if it means talking you into buying an inferior product
or one that costs more than you had planned to pay.
It’s best to maintain a healthy skepticism when getting
advice or reading online information that appears to give
advice. Sometimes, however, you will find an advice giver who
has no reason to give you bad advice; such people, if they are
experts, are good resources and should be trusted.
Consider Alternatives
What if you do not have enough money to buy the item, or
you decide not to spend as much money as the item costs?
Be especially
wary of “bait-
and-switch’’
advertising.
This advertising
technique
promotes a very
low price on a
particular item
(bait), but when
you try to buy it,
the salesperson
tries to sell
you something
“better” at a
higher price
(switch). If a sale
sounds too good
to be true, it
probably is.


16 PERSONAL MANAGEMENT
Being a Smart Shopper.
Remember that while you cannot always buy what you want,
you do have other choices. Sometimes you must compromise.
Part of being a good money manager means knowing when to
say no to yourself.
Do not be in a hurry to buy the newest product or the
latest thing, such as a just-released video game. The prices of
many products will drop after they have been on the market
for a while. Also, as in the case of many consumer electronics,
the next version probably will be more finely tuned—and
might even be less expensive.
Consider buying less-expensive items that have only the
features you need or want. The price probably will be cheaper.
If it is an item you can build, maybe you can save money by
buying the parts and assembling it yourself.
Consider buying used or generic (not a name brand)
items if the quality is similar. Demos, opened-box items, and/
or slightly flawed products often are available at lower cost.
When you are old enough to drive and start looking for
a car, remember that the value of a new car will depreciate
(drop in value) significantly once the car is sold. A good,
used car can be much less expensive. Check classified ads
in the newspaper or online listings for used items.
Impulse Buying
Moods or physical feelings can affect your buying decisions
and lead to impulse buying. So, be aware of what might be
behind your sudden urge to buy something.
For instance, shopping at the mall when you are hungry
could lead you to buy several snacks or even larger meals at
the food court. The money you spend on snacks could be used
to buy an item you really need or want instead. The same rule
applies when shopping for groceries: Do not go when you are
hungry or you might buy more food than needed.
Likewise, if you are feeling sad or angry, it might seem that
buying something will help you feel better. However, you might
spend money that you did not plan to spend. To help yourself
feel better, it might be better to go jogging, ride your bike or
skateboard, go to the library, or go fishing. The main thing is to
plan something that does not require you to spend money.
Many people buy items out of envy. In other words,
just because your friend bought an expensive bike with the
newest components does not mean that you must have one,
Avoid impulse
buying. Always
take time to
consider whether
you really need
or want the item.
By following
smart shopping
guidelines, you
will be less likely
to buy something
on the spur of
the moment and
less likely to
regret your
purchase later
(buyer’s remorse).


PERSONAL MANAGEMENT 17
.Being a Smart Shopper
too. Buy items that fit your budget, needs, and timeline; do not
buy something just so you can have the same thing someone
else has.
Similarly, do not let your money “burn a hole in your
pocket.” If you have been saving for something for a long time,
it might be tempting to spend the money. Be aware of that
impulse and stick to your plan. Also, when you are out and
about, just because you have money “in your pocket” doesn’t
mean you need to spend it. Use your money wisely.
Remember that all kinds of feelings can lead to impulse
buying. It might feel good at the moment to make the purchase,
but later you might regret having spent your money on some-
thing you did not need or really want and that delayed or
prevented you from reaching a savings goal.
Meeting a Family Financial Goal
To fulfill requirement 1, you will choose an item that your
family might like to purchase that is considered a major
expense. Before you choose the item, discuss with all members
of your family your plan to purchase something that benefits
the whole family and show how your family can save for the
item while still meeting other family needs.
As an example, let’s say your family has decided to buy a
TV. No matter what your family selects, many of the same
shopping techniques used to buy the television will apply to
your family’s decision. Remember, you and your family should
already have determined that your higher-priority needs have
been met before considering an unnecessary purchase.
When you feel
down, the good
feeling you get
when you spend
money is a
short-term
emotion; spending
money won’t solve
why you are
feeling sad
or angry.


18 PERSONAL MANAGEMENT
Being a Smart Shopper.
Many factors must be considered before making a big purchase.
If your family has decided to buy a TV, for example, you may
have to answer questions such as:
• How large is the room where you will put the TV, and what
screen size is recommended for a room of that dimension?
• What manufacturers produce the most reliable TVs?
• Does the TV require the purchase of any additional special
equipment and services in order to function properly,
optimally, and efficiently?
To determine the answers, read articles about televisions in
magazines, consumer guides, and on the internet. Talk to
salespeople in consumer electronics stores, and, if you can,
also talk to technicians who work on TVs. Do not rely on only
one source of information, and remember that salespeople
might highlight slow-selling or high-profit items rather than the
best product for your family.
Always read the warranty and/or guarantee. For instance,
check how long the manufacturer guarantees components.
Learn what customers must do to make sure the warranty
and/or guarantee stays valid.
While shopping for a TV, you might consider adding a
sound system. Will your family be content with the output
from the television’s speakers? Or does your family want to
invest in a surround-sound system, which can be quite
expensive? The surround-sound system could include a receiver
(to connect to the TV and speakers) and up to six or seven
speakers. Each of these items also should be researched.
While you research, make sure to check out the prices.
Look at ads and compare prices at different stores. Visit, call, or
browse the store’s website (with your parent or guardian’s
permission), if it has one. If your family makes its purchase from
a catalog or online, consider other factors. Remember to include
any shipping charges, sales taxes, and installation costs in the
overall cost of the purchase. Should there be any problems with
the product or setup, the customer service might be less
convenient than if you had purchased the item locally.
As you can see, making a well-informed decision on a
major purchase takes a lot of planning. Inexpensive items
require a similar amount of planning, too. Careful planning
makes buying decisions easier and ensures that you will be
happy with your purchase.
Your family must
take care of needs
such as food,
housing, insurance,
car payments,
school expenses,
utilities, and
clothes before
making a major
purchase. Once
these needs are
met, you can set
the goal of saving
for an item that
your family has
agreed to purchase.


PERSONAL MANAGEMENT 19
.Being a Smart Shopper
Cash or Credit?
In general, avoid buying ordinary items, such as meals, clothes, and
school supplies, on credit. Instead, limit credit purchases to special
expenses, such as a house, a car, or college tuition.
What if a retailer offers to sell credit with a very low interest rate?
Should you charge it rather than pay cash, or start saving for it? If the
rate is lower than what you are earning on savings or investments, it
might make sense to take advantage of the offer. But beware: Some
low rates actually are “teaser” rates—a low interest rate for a short
time (often three to six months) and then a much higher
interest rate until the loan has been repaid. Make sure to exercise
caution and read the fine print before you make a decision.
It is best to save your money to buy something you want rather
than charging the cost to your credit card. Resist impulse buying—the
item you want may still be available once you have saved your money.
In addition, there are several advantages to waiting. You will not have
to worry about paying high interest charges.
You will learn how to budget your money. The price of the item
might go down during the time it takes to save the money. You will
have more time to find the right item at the right price.
Credit cards, debit cards, and mobile device payment methods
can be convenient. Sometimes it makes sense to use a credit card,
debit card, or mobile device payment to buy everyday items instead
of carrying around a lot of cash, and it often is easier to return an
item if it was purchased with a credit card. Also, credit cards are
helpful in emergencies.
When you do use a credit card, make sure to pay off the balance
each month. If you do not, high interest rates will be charged to your
account (as much as 35 percent), which will dramatically increase the
effective cost of the items you purchased and quickly cause you to
fall into deep debt—a situation that is best avoided. The average U.S.
household carrying a credit card balance now owes over $10,000.
But more than 60 percent of households don’t carry a credit card
balance at all.


20 PERSONAL MANAGEMENT
Preparing a Personal Budget.
Preparing a
Personal Budget
The purpose of managing your money is to improve your ability
to meet obligations and reach your financial goals. One of the
best ways to learn how much you spend and earn over a period
of time is to keep a budget, or a written account of your
expected and actual income and expenses. A budget organizes
your finances to show how much income you plan to receive
and how much you actually receive, how you plan to spend it,
and how you actually spend it. By doing this, you will see
where the money you earn goes and how much, if any,
remains after your expenses. Sometimes a budget will reveal
that little expenses (such as buying a soft drink each day after
school) actually take a big chunk of your income.
Set up a budget worksheet to record all of your expenses
and income for 13 consecutive weeks. The worksheet should
include fixed expenses and flexible expenses. Fixed expenses
are predictable, regular obligations such as a home mortgage,
an auto loan, insurance premiums, and utilities. Currently,
your fixed expenses might include Scouting expenses. Flexible
expenses change each month. These include food, gifts,
entertainment, clothing, donations to your place of worship,
and personal care expenses.
One of the more important fixed expenses should be
a payment to yourself for savings and/or investments.
Of course, if you have money in savings, you can “borrow”
from yourself—but make it a priority to repay the money
taken from your savings. Make this your first payment and
treat it as a regular monthly expense. This is a better method
than trying to save from money left over after expenses. When
you start a career, often this payment can be automatically
deducted from your paychecks and deposited in a savings
or investment account.
By donating gifts
to a charity, you
can be among the
millions who help
fund a cause,
such as cancer
research and
arthritis research,
or services for the
homeless. Without
this money, many
charities would
not be able to fund
research and
improve lives.


PERSONAL MANAGEMENT 21
.Preparing a Personal Budget
It’s practical to set up categories in your budget that allow
you to combine several expenses. For example, “Entertainment”
could include movies, video games, mobile phone, and concert
tickets. If, however, the expenses in a subcategory are large,
you might add a separate category for one of the items—video
games, for example.
Including a “miscellaneous” expense category is essential.
No matter how hard you try, it is impossible to predict every
type of expense you might incur. Wise budgeters always
assume that 5 to 10 percent of their budget will go to things
they can’t anticipate.
How much should
you set aside to
pay yourself?
That figure will be
determined by
your income and
financial goals.
In general, try to
save at least
10 percent of
your income.

It’s important to show where all of your money goes.
This will give a better idea of where you spend your money
and where you can reduce spending, if necessary. A budget
that shows your basic living expenses could look something
like this.
To determine how much to allocate for spending in each
category, calculate your monthly income. Pay yourself first
and deduct fixed expenses, then determine your flexible, or
discretionary, expenses.
Good record keeping is necessary to help you maintain a
budget. Set aside time each week to work on your budget, and
try to make the budget simple to keep it manageable. Keep
receipts when possible. Record in a notebook, budget workbook,
or on your computer the date, any income you received,
and all expenses you paid. Include everything, even postage
stamps you used. At the end of each week, put the income
and expenses under the correct categories in your budget.
At the end of each month, balance all income and expenses.
As you will discover, budgets often need adjusting. Maybe
you do not have enough income to cover your expenses. In that
case, you must consider changes to your budget, including ways
to earn more money. You might have to reduce or eliminate
some nonessential expenses for a while, such as movies or
video games.
If you spend more in one category than you budgeted, you
might be able to adjust by spending less in another category. For

electronically, there are many software programs available on
the market—or you could design your own.

example, if you spent more on entertainment than the amount
you budgeted, try spending less on snacks or eating out.
How to Save Money
To save, you must first earn or receive income. Then, you can
set a savings goal, such as a new bike, a computer, college
tuition, or a birthday present for a friend or family member,
and determine how much you need to set aside
daily or weekly to reach that goal.
You might wonder what income sources you have available.
The following are some income sources you might be able to
include in your budget.
• Perhaps you receive a weekly or monthly allowance in
return for doing certain chores around the house.
• Ask if you can increase your allowance by doing
extra chores.
• Perhaps you could work part-time at a grocery store, fast-
food restaurant, movie theater, or golf course.
• You could start a business mowing lawns, shoveling snow,
caring for neighbors’ pets, repairing bikes or computers,
running errands for elderly neighbors, or tutoring.
• You probably can sell items you no longer use (with your
parent or guardian’s permission) that are still in good shape,
such as an old bike, old computer games, old music CDs,
collector cards, or athletic equipment.
• Save gifts of money that you receive for birthdays,
Christmas, bar/bat mitzvah, or other special occasions.
If you have a job or receive an allowance, you probably can
predict what your income will be while you save for your goal.
It might be more difficult to estimate your expenses, however.
Because your budget clearly shows the choices you can make
to reach financial goals, it can help you plan how to spend your
money wisely. You can add any money left over at the end of a
month to savings or keep it to spend the next month.
To increase the amount you save, think of expenses you
can give up and other cost-saving measures. Another option is
to change your goal. Perhaps you need more time to reach
your goal or need to find a less-expensive option. For example,
if you were saving for a new bike, maybe you could save for a
less expensive one.
The amount of
earnings left after
an employer has
deducted federal
and state income
taxes, Social
Security, and other
items such as
health insurance
and stock
purchases, is your
take-home pay.


When you are ready to open a savings or checking account, go with your parents or
guardian to a local bank, where a representative will help you get started.

.Using Bank Accounts
Using Bank Accounts
Banks and credit unions keep money safe while also giving
people easy access to their money. While banks and credit
unions offer different kinds of accounts, such as checking,
savings, and loan accounts, most people first open a savings
account in which to store money for financial goals or
an emergency.
Banks are for-profit corporations that must make money
for their owners by paying low interest rates on savings and
charging high loan rates. Credit unions are nonprofit financial
cooperatives that give the profits to their members by paying
more interest on savings and charging lower loan rates. If there
is a credit union near you that you are eligible to use, you may
get better rates there than at most banks. For simplicity, the
word “bank” is used in this chapter, but all discussions about
banks apply equally to credit unions.
Keeping money in a savings account is wiser than keeping
cash in a dresser drawer at home. First, the federal government
insures the money kept in bank accounts against loss or theft.


28 PERSONAL MANAGEMENT
Using Bank Accounts.
A fire, or other natural disaster, could destroy your money
if it is kept at home. Second, savings accounts earn interest.
The bank pays interest on the money in your savings account
because, in actuality, when you put money into a savings
account you are loaning the money to the bank so that it can
give loans to other customers. The interest rate usually is low,
but it is more than your money will earn at home.
As you begin earning money and paying bills or dues, you
probably will want to open a checking account, too. With a
checking account, you can write checks or use a debit card to
make purchases using the money in the account. Checks
and debit cards are convenient ways to pay bills and make
purchases. They also can be safer than carrying around a
large amount of cash, which could be lost or stolen.
After opening a checking account, you must keep good
records so that you always know how much money is in your
account (your balance) and can avoid writing a check to pay
for something when you do not have enough money in your
account to cover the cost. If you overdraw your account,
the bank and the company to which you wrote the check
can charge penalties to your account (overdraft charges).
Remember, just because you have checks remaining does not
mean you have money in your account. Keep track of what’s
in your account by checking the balance, either online or
directly with the bank, and know what checks you wrote that
have not yet been cashed.

PERSONAL MANAGEMENT 29
.Using Bank Accounts
A debit card for your checking or savings account
looks just like a credit card and can be used like
one, too. The difference is that, traditionally, your
debit card draws on the actual money in your bank
account and not on a line of credit as your credit
card does. Thus, if you try to spend more money
than you have in your account, the transaction is
rejected immediately at the cash register. Debit
cards also allow you to withdraw or deposit money
at automated teller machines (ATM) or through an
app on your mobile phone. However, depending on
the bank and the ATM, you might be charged a fee
for using this service.
Recently, many banks have offered debit cards
with “free” overdraft protection. This is a service
whereby if you spend more than you have in your
bank account (for example, to buy a pack of gum
for $1), the transaction isn’t rejected. However, you
will have to pay the bank an overdraft fee (which
may be $35 or more) each time you do this, in
addition to having to pay back the excess spent
money. In this example, that $1 pack of gum may
end up costing you $36 or more! It is best to make
sure your bank does NOT provide this “free”
overdraft protection for your debit card.


Banks typically offer different types of checking accounts.
Some banks pay interest on checking accounts, much like a
savings account. Generally, though, banks charge a fee for the
checking service to cover the costs of processing the checks.
Fees can be based on how much money you keep in your
account and how many checks you write. Shop around
because checking account features and fees vary widely.
Electronic banking involves accessing your bank accounts
by debit card, phone, and computer. Because no paper or
people are involved in transferring the money, electronic
banking is convenient. Of course, this convenience also makes
it more tempting to impulsively spend money. You will need to
devise a way to track your deposits and withdrawals in order
to monitor your account balance and stick to your budget.
When it’s time to choose a bank, shop around! Look for
those that pay the highest interest rate on savings and charge
the lowest fees on services you will use. Be aware that some
banks charge a “low balance” fee if your account has less than
a certain amount of money in it—but some don’t do this, or
the balance threshold is lower. Some banks charge a fee each
time you use an ATM to get cash, but some actually reimburse
that fee. A wise consumer will check the fine print to find a
bank that offers good rates, convenience, and low fees on
services. Remember to consider credit unions and online
banking in your comparisons.

.Saving Versus Investing
Saving Versus Investing
In your budget, one of your expenses is a payment to yourself
for savings or investment. To help you make an informed deci-
sion about whether to save or invest that payment, information
about the differences between saving and investing follows.
To save money means to put it aside, in a bank account,
for buying something in the near future or to have on hand in
case of an emergency. That money is available for you to
withdraw whenever you need it. Although the bank may pay
interest on the balance in your savings account, that interest
often does not keep up with inflation, which is the rise in the
cost of goods over time. Therefore, savings accounts are only
one portion of a balanced financial plan.
When you invest money, you have an entirely different
objective: to make more for eventual use in the distant future.
A financial investment is something you put money into with
the purpose of getting more money back. An investment also
can be one of time and labor. For example, you might invest in
a lawn mower with the goal of making enough money mowing
lawns over the summer to earn a profit.
A return on
investment (ROI)
is the profit from,
or increase in
value, of the
investment; total
return is the
combination of
an investment’s
income and
its increase or
decrease in value.


32 PERSONAL MANAGEMENT
Saving Versus Investing.
You also are an investment. You can invest in yourself
through education, for example, or by learning new skills or
trades. Education and self-improvement can help you earn
more income. In fact, of all the types of investments available,
investing in yourself is the best investment you can make. It
can pay big dividends.
Unlike saving, investing involves some risk—that is, you
are not guaranteed to earn more than the amount you invest.
(The amount you invest is called principal.) In fact, there is a
chance you could lose part or even all of the principal.
Investing is used to achieve certain types of goals. People
typically save for short-term goals such as a new car or a
family vacation by putting their money in a savings account
where they can retrieve all of the money plus a little interest.
But people invest for long-term goals like college or retire-
ment. They put their money in stocks and bonds through
mutual funds, or in real estate or other alternatives. These
options do not guarantee the principal invested or any earn-
ings on the principal. However, because of the greater risk,
investors have a chance to earn higher returns (income or
an increase in value) than they would from a savings
account, especially over a long time. While everybody
wants low risk and high return, risk and return are virtually
always “joined at the hip”—you can’t get high returns
without taking on high risk and if you take on low risk,
you guarantee low returns.
A loaned investment means you loan money to a company or gov-
ernment in return for its promise to repay the principal (the amount
you loaned) plus interest. Such an investment is similar to how you
“loan” money to a bank through a savings account except that there
is only a promise to repay the money, not a guarantee. The issuer
makes regular payments of interest, usually monthly or quarterly, for
a set length of time.
Common loaned investments include money market funds,
certificates of deposit, U.S. government bonds, and corporate,
municipal (city), and foreign bonds. Loaned investments tend to
carry little to no risk. Accordingly, as we have learned, they generally
have correspondingly low returns.


PERSONAL MANAGEMENT 33
.Saving Versus Investing
Investments are subject to different levels of risk—the
extent to which an investment goes up and down over time.
The value of investments with higher risk, such as stocks,
will tend to go up and down a lot. The value of less risky
investments, such as bonds, will rise and fall less
dramatically. Young investors who are saving for retirement
should keep enough low-risk investments in their overall
portfolio so they can get through the ups and downs without
too much worry and stress.
Diversification means owning many different investments
instead just one or a few. For example, owning a single stock
would be a real problem if that company’s finances collapsed,
whereas owning multiple stocks that have similar expected
returns will reduce the risk. In general, having a very
diversified portfolio is best. Small investors can find it
difficult to buy enough individual stocks for this, so they are
often best served by mutual funds—professionally managed
investments that hold many individual stocks in each fund.
Types of Investments
Financial investments take two basic forms: owned investments
or loaned investments. That is, you are either a lender or
an owner.
A loaned investment means you loan money to a company
or government in return for its promise to repay the principal
(the amount you loaned) plus interest. Such an investment is
similar to how you “loan” money to a bank through a savings
account except that there is only a promise to repay the money,
not a guarantee. The issuer makes regular payments of income,
usually monthly or quarterly, for a set length of time.
Common loaned investments include money market funds;
certificates of deposit; U.S. government bonds; corporate,
municipal (city), and foreign bonds.
Annuities are another type of investment option offered by
insurance companies. Part investment and part insurance plan,
annuities are aggressively sold by insurance companies
because they carry several layers of high fees that make them
very profitable for the companies and the salespeople.
However, they are unsuitable for investors in most situations.
You might already own one form of loaned investment if
you have a savings bond. These make popular gifts for families
and others to buy for children because savings bonds can be

bought in small amounts (as little as $25). Savings bonds are a
loan to the federal government. Bond issuers agree to repay the
bondholder the amount invested plus interest over a set period
of time. Governments or companies issue bonds to raise money
to pay for certain projects, such as building roads and factories.
Also popular are certificates of deposit (CDs), which are
issued by banks. The investor lends the bank a specific amount
of money for a specific period of time at a specific interest rate.
This low-risk investment pays low but steady returns.
An owned investment means you own part or all of a
company, real estate, or other asset. An asset is an item of
value. If you buy stock in a large fast-food restaurant chain,
for example, you actually own part of the company. Other
people who bought stock in the company also own part of
it. Because you own part of the company, you share in any
profits or losses.
Common types of owned investments include the following:
• Stocks of U.S. and foreign companies
• Shares in stock mutual funds
• Real estate (land, homes, apartments, office buildings)
• Personal business, such as a retail store
Naturally, you would want to put your money into a low-
risk investment that yields a high return. However, such invest-
ments are unlikely. Low-risk investments, such as government
savings bonds, usually have a low rate of return. Conversely,
investments having the potential for a high rate of return—
such as stocks and mutual funds—are higher-risk.
People investing over a shorter period of time should
choose safer investments with lower rates of return. However,
investors seeking larger growth of their money over an extend-
ed period of time may choose riskier investments. In general,
buying stocks is considered more risky than investing in some-
thing that pays a guaranteed rate of interest.
Government Savings Bonds. U.S. savings bonds are consid-
ered safe investments because they are backed by the full faith
and credit of the federal government. Two common savings
bonds are the Series EE and Series I. Series EE bonds are pur-
chased electronically at face value, and can be bought for any
amount from $25 up to $10,000 per year. EE bonds issued since
May 2005 earn a fixed rate of interest. You know the interest

the bond will earn when you buy it. You may cash in the bond
at any point from 12 months through 30 years, but if you cash
them in before five years you will forfeit the previous three
months’ interest.
I bonds (the “I” stands for inflation) are purchased for
face value, so you would pay $50 for a $50 bond. I bonds pay
two types of interest—a fixed rate of interest plus an inflation
amount that is announced every six months. When you cash
in your I bond, you will receive the amount you invested plus
both types of interest. While you can cash in your I bonds
after 12 months, they are meant to be a long-term investment.
Therefore, you will be charged a penalty fee equal to three
months of interest if you cash these bonds in within five years
of purchase.
Insured Certificates of Deposit (CD). CDs are insured
deposits that pay a fixed or variable interest rate over a
specific period of time. Financial institutions offer CDs that
mature in as few as three months or after many years. Your
money must stay invested for a fixed period, so CDs generally
pay more interest than savings accounts. Usually, the interest
rate is higher the longer you hold the CD.
However, as with other low-risk investments, the return
usually is low. If you want to buy a CD, shop around at vari-
ous banks and financial institutions to find the highest inter-
est rate being offered for the term you want.
Stock mutual funds have a higher expected return on
average and in the long run, although the risk is more than an
insured CD. If you want to buy a CD, shop around at various
banks and financial institutions to find the highest interest rate
being offered for the term you want.
Mutual Funds. If you decided that you wanted to buy stocks,
which stocks would you buy? Average investors have no idea
how to wisely choose stocks to invest in. Plus, buying
individual stocks goes against the rule that you should be as
diversified as possible. Mutual funds provide a useful
solution. They combine money from many investors to hire a
manager to invest their money. Further, it is easier for a fund
with many millions (or billions) of dollars to accumulate a
well-diversified portfolio than you could build on your own.
Generally, you can buy or sell a mutual fund directly
with a mutual fund company, or through a brokerage
company. Mutual funds focus on buying stocks, bonds, or

36 PERSONAL MANAGEMENT

various other investment categories; most focus primarily on
stocks.
Index funds mechanically buy the stocks in a particular
index. For example, an S&P 500 Index Fund would buy the
500 stocks in the S&P 500 Index in the proportions indicated
by the index. Mechanically buying the stocks of an index is
easy and inexpensive for the fund. Studies have shown that
professionals choosing which stocks to buy don’t (and can’t
— on average) outperform indexes of the investment
universes which they pick from. Exchange-Traded Funds
(ETFs) are mutual funds that are bought and sold on a stock
exchange like a stock. While these can be quite inexpensive
and well-diversified, they are more difficult to buy and sell
them than conventional mutual funds.
The Power of Compounding
When you save and invest your money, you help the money
itself earn more money. The ability of money to grow on its
own can be extremely valuable to achieving long-term goals
and in giving you financial security when you grow older.
Money earns more money when it draws simple and
compound interest. Simple interest is the interest earned on the
deposit amount, or principal. For example, if you put $100 into
an account that earns 6 percent interest annually, that invest-
ment would be worth $106 at the end of the year.
Compound interest, in addition to paying interest on the
principal, pays interest on the interest earned. To illustrate
how compounding works, imagine what happens to a $100
investment when the earned interest is withdrawn each year
and not left in the account to draw more interest. Say the $100
earns 10 percent, compounded annually. At the end of the first
year, the total investment is worth $110. If you withdraw the
$10 and leave the $100 invested, you will have $110 at the end
of the second year. If you do this each year for 10 years, your
$100 investment will have earned $100, all of which was
withdrawn and spent.
But consider what would happen if you did not withdraw
the first $10 of interest. If you leave it with the original $100, the
second year’s interest will be based on $110, not $100. At the end
of the second year, your investment will have earned $11 and the
total will have grown to $121. Again, if you reinvest your earn-


PERSONAL MANAGEMENT 37
.Saving Versus Investing
ings, you will earn 10 percent on $121 instead of $100, as in the
first example.
If you do this for 10 years, your initial investment will
have grown to $159.39, which is $59.39 more than if you
withdrew the
interest each year.
What is more, the
investment’s total
value will have
grown to $259.39,
with the earnings
becoming greater
with each passing
year. That is why
compounding
makes such a

over time.

Investing for Retirement
Most people intend to retire at age 65 or a bit later.
When to start investing for retirement. While age 65 might
seem like a long way off for you (and it is), the best time to
start investing for retirement is as soon as you enter the work-
force. If you start early, it is much easier to accumulate enough
assets by the time you want to retire. Unfortunately, many
people don’t start until they are in their 50s—and by then, it is
almost impossible to accumulate as much in assets as you will
really need to live comfortably in retirement. The best time to
start is as soon as you possibly can!
How much to invest. The more you can “sock away” for
retirement, the better. Many people have student loans to
pay off when they enter the workforce. A good plan is to
aggressively pay off those student loans first—perhaps by
dedicating about 20 percent of your salary to it. Then, once
the loads are paid off, you can start putting that same 20
percent into your retirement account. Ideally, you would
contribute the maximum allowed to the retirement account,
and force yourself to live on what is left. If you start doing this
early and continue through all the years you work, you won’t
miss having the extra money to spend (because you never had
it in the first place).
What to invest in. There are several “tax-advantaged” ways of
contributing money toward retirement, including 401(k),
403(b), and 457 plans, traditional IRAs, and Roth IRAs. They
can do a lot to help you accumulate the assets you will need
while giving you the advantages associated with tax deferral
and tax avoidance.
• Some employers contribute matching funds to their employ-
ee’s retirement plans. For example, they might add 50 cents
for every dollar you contribute, up to perhaps 4 percent of
your salary. If you are fortunate enough to receive this offer,
you should contribute, at the very least, as much as neces-
sary to get the maximum amount of this “free money.”
• While contributing to a retirement plan offered by your
employer, you can also contribute to your own traditional or
Roth IRA accounts, if you have them. Be aware, however,
that contributions to these tax-advantaged accounts are basi-


PERSONAL MANAGEMENT 39
.Saving Versus Investing
cally “locked in” until you are at least 59½ years old. If you
want to take out the money before then, you will be penal-
ized along with paying taxes on it.
• Within a retirement plan, you will typically need to select
one or more mutual funds to invest in. The same advice
applies here as for nonretirement investing: Choose mutual
funds that are low in cost, well diversified, and “no-load”
(which means the shares are sold without a commission or
sales charge). For retirement investing, most fund companies
have developed funds specifically designed to be all-in-one
investment programs for those intending to retire around a
specific year. These are known as target-date funds: As you
approach your retirement year, the investments are moved
gradually to more conservative shares—with more bonds
and fewer stocks—just as an expert financial advisor
might recommend. As with other funds, you should shop
around for the no-load target date funds with the lowest
expense ratio.
• While it is possible to open a retirement account at a
brokerage firm, you can also open one directly at a
fund company.


Borrowing Money.
40 PERSONAL MANAGEMENT
Borrowing Money
At some point in your life, you may need to borrow
money, whether to buy a car, a house, or to pay for a
college education. When you borrow money to buy
something you are buying it on credit, which is
another way of saying that you took out a loan.
Maybe you have borrowed money from a
friend or a family member and repaid it in a day
or two. If you could not pay back the sum in
one payment, you might have made smaller,
regular payments, called installments. If you
borrowed $10, for example, perhaps you repaid
it over a month at $2.50 a week. This type of
borrowing is straightforward because you pay back
exactly the amount loaned to you.
However, most loans require that you pay back
not only what you borrowed (the principal) but also a
finance charge (interest). Lenders, such as banks, charge
borrowers for the privilege of temporarily using the lender’s
money. Remember, the bank may pay interest on your savings
account because you are letting the bank use your money.
The total finance charge depends on several factors:
1. The amount you borrow.
2. The amount of any fees charged by the lender.
3. The interest rate charged, which is generally a percentage
of the principal. For example, if you borrow $10 at 5 percent
interest, you would pay back $10, plus 50 cents.
4. How long it takes you to repay the loan.
Naturally, it is better to save money in order to make purchases
without borrowing. Paying finance charges adds to the real cost
of the item you are buying. However, sometimes it is difficult to
save enough money to pay for expensive items, such as a car, a
house, or college tuition, and you have to borrow.


PERSONAL MANAGEMENT 41
.Borrowing Money
When it is time for you to borrow, the following tips will help
reduce your costs.
• Shop around. Different lenders charge different interest
rates. An interest rate that is just one percentage point lower
can provide substantial savings.
• Compare the annual percentage rate (APR), not just the
simple interest rate. The APR reflects the true percentage
rate of a loan because it takes into account various fees
and other costs over the life of the loan. The APR is always
higher than the simple interest on a loan, unless there are
no additional fees or other charges. While loans may include
fees and other costs in the APR calculation, credit cards
normally do not do so. As a result, the APR for credit cards
does not accurately reflect the total amount you must repay.
• Ask what the total cost of the loan will be in dollars and
cents. The lender must disclose this.
• Find out the amount of any and all fees. Fees add up
quickly and can greatly increase the cost of a loan.
• Do not always choose the loan with the lowest payment.
A lower payment might mean a longer payment period. The
longer you take to repay a loan, the more you will pay in total
interest charges. If you take five years to pay off a car loan
instead of three, you could pay 60 percent more in interest.
• Ask if there is a charge for paying off the loan early—for
example, paying off a three-year loan in two years. Try to get
loans that do not penalize you for repaying the balance early.
Paying off the loan early can save you interest payments.
Before you borrow, the lender will check on you, just as you
should check out the lender. The lender must be confident that
you have the ability to repay the loan. You probably will need to
prove that you have steady income, and, if you have borrowed
money before, you will need to show that you paid it back. The
lender also might ask for references. These are other people or
businesses that will state that you are trustworthy.
In some cases, a loan must be secured. This means that if
you fail to make payments the lender can take possession of
whatever you bought with the money you borrowed, such as a
car or house.
When it comes
to securing a
loan and using
credit cards
(and not paying
off the balance
every month),
compounding
works against you.


Borrowing Money.
Credit Cards
A credit card is a form of loan—just as if you had borrowed
cash from a bank. It can be a convenient substitute for carry-
ing checks or a large amount of cash and especially useful in
emergencies. However, because credit cards do not seem like
real money and are easy to use, people often buy items they
cannot afford and that they cannot pay for when the credit
card bill is due. In fact, credit cards do represent real money;
using them unwisely can lead to financial difficulties.
A credit card, issued by a bank or credit card company,
can be used to pay for any product or service as long as the
seller accepts the card. Not all sellers accept credit cards or a
particular type of credit card, however.
In addition, credit cards have a charge limit, which means
you can charge only up to the amount the credit card issuer
allows. The limit usually is based on your income, credit history,
and other factors that might affect your ability to repay. When
you reach your credit limit, you must stop using the credit card
until you pay off at least some of the accumulated debt.
When you use a credit card to buy something (a process
called charging), you will swipe your card, insert your chip-
enabled card, tap your card to the reader, or use a contactless
payment technology such as Apple Pay to complete your
payment. The store receives payment from the bank that
issued the credit card, and the bank collects the cost of the
purchase from you.
You are billed each month for the total amount charged.
You must pay the minimum amount stated on the bill each
month. If you do not repay the entire balance, instead paying
only part of it, a finance charge will be added to the unpaid
balance. This can be expensive because the annual interest
rate can be 18 percent or more. The longer it takes to pay off
the balance, the more costly the items you bought become.
Credit cards look like and can be used in much the same
way as debit cards and charge cards. Because a debit card is
connected to your checking account, the costs of any purchases
you make with it are automatically deducted from your checking
account.
By the time you
reach your late
teens, you
probably will
have received
numerous offers
from credit card
companies to
apply for their
cards. Just
remember that
you are personally
responsible and
legally obligated
to pay back all
amounts charged
to your card.

.Borrowing Money
Credit Record
When you begin using a credit card or when you take out a
loan from a bank, you will begin building a “credit record”—
a history of how well you have paid your bills. It is much like
the history of a baseball player’s career. If you trade baseball
cards, you know that a player’s playing history usually is
recorded on the back of the card. You can tell at a glance
whether a player is a good hitter, pitcher, or fielder.
Companies called credit bureaus keep track of the credit
histories of individuals. Your history will tell whether you are
good at paying back your debts. Anyone offering credit to you
likely will check with credit bureaus to see if you have paid
your bills promptly.
People who do not use credit responsibly can get into
serious debt. Some people use too much credit and owe more
than they can reasonably pay back. If this happens to you, you
might not be given additional credit when you need it
sometime in the future. Some businesses, including potential
employers, also might check credit histories. It pays to
maintain a good credit history by paying your bills on time.
If you do get into debt problems, here are some tips to
help reduce or eliminate debt:
• Stop buying things you do not need. See what you can
do without for a while, such as movies, video games,
and snacks.
• Pay cash for purchases. Do not charge anything.
• Perform “plastic surgery.” Cut up your credit cards if you
cannot stop from using them.
• Make a budget to track your income and expenses.
• Try to earn extra money to help pay off debts.
College-bound Scouts, don’t become credit bound, too. Many colleges
and universities join with major credit card issuers to offer students
credit cards because the school receives hefty fees in return. If you
are in the market for a credit card, shop around just like you would
for any other “product.” Look for a low interest and low or no annual
fee. Once you have a card in hand, use it responsibly and pay your
bills on time. Pay the whole amount due each month—not just the
minimum payment allowed—and keep your credit limit low so that
you can’t overindulge.





PERSONAL MANAGEMENT 45
.Planning Your Time
Planning Your Time
It is important to learn to manage time just as you have learned
to manage money—carefully and with thought. As you learn
how to take more responsibility for yourself, managing your
time is one important way of serving that aim. Everybody has
the same amount of time each day; we spend it the way we
choose. If we spend time wisely, it can pay dividends, just as an
investment does. Many people do not realize it, but by using
time more effectively, they can reduce stress, be more produc-
tive, and usually have more time to relax and enjoy life.
There is no perfect way to balance your time, but there
are a number of plans. These plans often direct you to change
how you think, act, and use your time. You will discover that
by organizing your life and time, sometimes in little ways, you
can spend your time wisely.
Setting Goals
Sometimes it might seem that you do not have the same amount
of time that you did when you were younger. However, you
had the same number of hours in a day then as you do now.
You just had fewer things to do.
To make the most of your time as you become busier, set
goals, just as you do to manage your money. Plan the activities
you need and want to do, and then determine how to accom-
plish them. Doing this can go a long way toward helping you
use your time effectively.
Part of planning your time wisely includes making
sure you get the sleep you need to function well
during the day. Getting a good night’s rest helps
make sure you have the energy and mental focus
you need for school, play, and work.
You don’t have
much choice over
when you need to
wake up on
school days or
work days, but
you usually can
control when you
go to sleep, so be
sure you are going
to bed early
enough.


46 PERSONAL MANAGEMENT
Planning Your Time.
To get started, list your short-term and long-term goals.
Short-term goals are those things that you want or need to
do today, tomorrow, or in the next week. They might include
finishing a homework assignment, going to a troop meeting, or
going to baseball practice. Long-term goals are things you
want to accomplish over the next several weeks, months, or
years. These could include writing a term paper, earning two
or three merit badges, learning a foreign language or to play a
musical instrument, or studying subjects that will help you in
a career.
Studies show that those who take the time to write down and prioritize their
long-term goals are more likely to fulfill those goals.
Organizing your short-term and long-term goals is
like playing a football game. Short-term goals
include making first downs and advancing the foot-
ball. The long-term goal is to cross the goal line and
score a touchdown. It takes planning to do that.


PERSONAL MANAGEMENT 47
.Planning Your Time
Be specific about what you want to do, such as complet-
ing two merit badges, and when you will do it, including the
number of days, weeks, or months. Estimate how long it might
take in hours and how you are going to accomplish it, such as
setting aside a set number of hours each day or each weekend.
When planning, start with the end result and work backward.
This will give you a better idea of how long it will take to
reach the goal.
Writing down your goals helps you see what and how
much you need to do. Pin your list of long-term goals to a
bulletin board or in some other prominent location. List your
short-range goals on a calendar or some other daily organizer.
This is your “to do” list for the week. Today, for example,
you might need to read a chapter in one of your schoolbooks,
go to sports practice, and then study for a test in another
school subject.
Do not limit your choice of goals and activities just yet.
Write them all down. Then use the next section to help you
figure out which ones deserve more of your time and help
you schedule those activities.
Setting Priorities
Because we do not have the time to do everything we need or
want to do, it is important to set priorities. You already learned
something about priorities when you set your goals. By deciding
what you most want to do in the future, you decided many of
your most immediate priorities.
Some priorities will be obvious, such as homework, going
to Scout meetings, attending worship services, and getting to
work on time. Other priorities will be less clear. Perhaps you
want to assemble a plastic model or improve your pitching
technique for baseball. Maybe you want to earn two merit
badges in a certain time frame. How will you have enough
time to do all of these activities? Setting priorities will help
you determine which goals are more important to you.
Study your short-term and long-term lists and ask yourself
if you really want, or need, to do each activity. Number each
item from most important to least important—from 1 to 10, for
example, with 1 having top priority. Then begin work on the
most important items first. You will focus your attention on
these before moving to items lower on the priority list.
Setting priorities
often means
that you will
need to give
up a short-term
pleasure so that
you can enjoy a
more rewarding
pleasure in the
future. As you
develop the
self-discipline
to follow your
priorities, you will
gain self-esteem
and personal
satisfaction.


48 PERSONAL MANAGEMENT
Planning Your Time.
Accomplishing Goals
Now that you have listed your priorities, it is time to get started
on the list of things to do. Getting started can be the hardest
part. People are more likely to
procrastinate, or put off tasks, when
a project is large or unpleasant or the
deadline is a long time away. One
trick is to break down large tasks
into smaller ones. You also can do
this when working on a long-term
goal. For example, if you have a
term paper due in six weeks, break
up the tasks into stages, such as
the following:
1. Collect research materials.
2. Take notes on research materials.
3. Organize notes and write
an outline.
4. Write a first draft.
5. Write a second draft.
6. Prepare the final copy.
Set a deadline for each stage and
write deadlines on your calendar. For
example, you might collect research
material this week, take notes next
week, and so on. By doing this, the
term paper becomes several smaller,
more manageable tasks instead of
one large, difficult project.
For requirement 8(c), you will need to track your
progress as you follow your seven-day “to-do” list.
Then, for requirement 8(d), you will need to review
your “to-do” list, schedule, and journal to determine
when your schedule worked and didn’t work. Your
counselor will help you understand how to make
some adjustments so that all these tools work
for—not against—you.
Before you start, remove clutter and organize
your work area. The less time you spend
searching for information or tools, the faster
you will finish. Also, eliminate potential
distractions and minimize interruptions
such as phone calls or text messages.
Return calls and messages after you have
finished your tasks.

Time-Saving Tips
These tips can help you manage your time more wisely, avoid
spreading yourself too thin, and be prepared for unexpected
delays or emergencies.
Reward yourself for accomplishments along the way. Tell
yourself you will get a snack, call a friend, shoot some
hoops, or relax for a few minutes after finishing a
particular homework assignment or chore.
Schedule some relaxation time each day.
Avoid filling each minute of the day with a
task. Everyone needs a little time to relax,
watch TV, read, play a game, or simply
do nothing.
Schedule “emergency” time. Activities
often take longer than planned and, some-
times, unexpected things happen. When you
plan your day, schedule a little extra time to use
in case you get behind.
Check off each item as you complete it so that you
can see your progress. This is especially helpful when
you break down a large project into smaller ones.
Try to schedule the most difficult tasks for the time of day
when you are the most productive. Some people are more
productive in the morning, and others are more productive
in the afternoon or evening.
Be flexible and make adjustments if necessary.
Ask for help or directions if you are unsure about something.
It could save much time.
Eliminate low-priority items. Ask yourself, “What don’t I have
to do?” and erase unnecessary tasks from your “to do” list.
Say no. This could mean saying no to yourself and to family
and friends about doing things that might interfere with your
work. Commit yourself to things that you must do or really
want to do.
Stop often and ask yourself, “What is the best use of my
time right now?”
Reevaluate your goals from time to time. They might change
as time passes.


PERSONAL MANAGEMENT 51
.Planning Your Time
Planning a Project
For any project you undertake, including
education or vacation, a plan will help you gain
a better understanding of what it will take to
accomplish it.
Let’s say you are organizing a camping trip
for your family. First, consider the project’s scope.
What will be the purpose or goal of the trip? Will
you need special equipment or training? How long
will the trip be: one day, overnight, or longer?
Planning will involve deciding where to go,
how you will get there, and how long it will take
to travel there. What activities do your family
members like? You probably will want to go to a
place where you can do these activities. Or,
maybe your family wants a new adventure. You
also will need to determine the best season to go
and, if possible, see what the long-range weather
forecast will be.
For example, if your main goal is to go hiking,
bird watching, or to visit a natural or historical
site, then you and your family probably will stay
at one location. The equipment needed probably
will not include more than hiking or walking
shoes, maybe binoculars, and appropriate clothing.
However, a camping trip might include more
activities, such as canoeing, rappelling,
backpacking, bicycling, skiing, or collecting
specimens of rocks and flowers. These activities
require special training and/or special equipment.
Also, a camping trip probably will be longer than
a day or two and might involve changing your
campsite location once or twice.
Check out the various options for places to
stay and know what is required to stay there.
The National Park Service, state and county
parks and recreation departments, the Forest
Service, Army Corps of Engineers, or the Bureau
of Land Management administer many
campsites. Some sites might be privately owned
or require reservations.
You can use a note-
book, a pocket or wall
calendar, or a spread-
sheet to keep track of
tasks, appointments,
notes, addresses, and
phone numbers.
Another way to orga-
nize your life is to
use a smartphone or
electronic tablet. These
electronic devices can,
however, be pricey.


52 PERSONAL MANAGEMENT
Planning Your Time.
Also find out what facilities are available, such as
restrooms, showers, potable water, picnic tables, electricity,
types of shelters, phones, and whether campfires are allowed.
You can find this information on the internet, in camping
guidebooks, or by phone.
Next, determine the type of and how many clothes you
will need on the trip. Checking the weather forecast will help
you decide what clothing and other gear you may need. You
also will need to plan how much food, water, personal hygiene
and first-aid supplies, cooking utensils, maps, and other gear
you must take. Make a list and check off each item as you
pack it.
The length and destination of your trip, as well as the
activities you plan to do, will be determined in part by your
trip budget and the time you have. You might discover that the
trip you want to take could cost more than you can afford, in
which case, you will have to decide what activities or
equipment to subtract. Among the trip’s expenses will be fees
for campsites and/or any activities you plan to do. Other
expenses will include the costs of any special equipment,
travel, food and other supplies, and any required permits. You
might not have enough time to do all the activities you have
planned. You will need to prioritize those things you really
want to do as opposed to those things you would like to do.
The more planning you do for a project, the less likely it
will be that you will encounter surprises. However, it would be
wise to develop a backup plan in case something changes,
such as the weather conditions in the area you plan to visit.
As you plan your activity,
develop a list of resources such
as weather and visitors’
bureaus or tourist information
offices for the area you plan to
visit. Perhaps you might find
coupons for discounts and
family or group rates. Ask your
librarian at school or a public
library for help, or (with your
parent or guardian’s permission)
surf the internet.

Thinking About Your Future.
Thinking About
Your Future
You probably have thought about what you would like to do
for a living when you become an adult. Perhaps you have
dreamed of being a professional athlete, musician, pilot, truck
driver, computer programmer, teacher, architect, horse trainer,
police officer, auto mechanic, or the president of your own
company. These are careers—your life’s work.
Your career path probably will
involve training and/or education and
holding positions that have increasing
responsibility. For example, a student
might enjoy writing for a high school
newspaper and earn a four-year degree
in journalism before gaining a position
as a reporter for a small local newspa-
per. Over the years, work experience
will gain the journalist higher positions
at larger publications and ultimately,
perhaps, the title of executive
editor at a national newspaper or
other publication.
As you think about career possibilities and your
future, it helps to identify your interests first. Once
you pinpoint those interests, then you can explore the
opportunities available in those areas. Being a skilled
writer will help no matter what profession you end up
choosing. You won’t regret fine-tuning your writing
skills now to be better prepared for the future.


PERSONAL MANAGEMENT 55
.Thinking About Your Future
People hold many different positions throughout their
lives, and often people change careers. Experts say that, on
average, people go through 10 different positions and three
different careers during their working lives.
A career is a way to earn money. You are paid money
for performing certain duties. But a career should be more
than a way to make a living. Ideally, it should be emotionally,
spiritually, and intellectually satisfying as well. Try choosing a
career that you are good at doing and one that you truly like.
It can be tough to work in a position that you do not like, even
if you are earning a lot of money.
Exploring Career Possibilities
If you are still trying to decide what career you would like to
pursue, do not worry. Sometimes career decisions are not made
until college or later. There is nothing wrong with that. It often
is difficult to determine what you want to do. Or, perhaps you
already have a good idea of what you want to do, especially if
you are nearing high school graduation. Either way, you can
do a number of things to explore potential careers.
First, ask yourself what you do well, think about your
values and your ambitions, and make a list. What are your
hobbies? What do you enjoy doing? What are your best
subjects in school? You are more likely to succeed in a career
if it is a field in which you can use your talents and that
you enjoy. For example, if you are good in mathematics and
science, you might pursue a career in engineering or computer
science. But, do not be restricted by what you are good at
doing. Instead, use these skills as a guide.
Find out the level of education you will need for the
career that interests you. Does the occupation require technical
education and training? A bachelor’s degree or graduate school
and training? What about internships? You will need to review
your long-term goals and determine how much time you are
willing to devote to training and education before actually
earning a living even begins.
Consider your salary needs and earning potential. Money
alone does not bring happiness, but it is an important factor.
For some people, making money is their reward for working.
You can decide whether making money or doing something
that you enjoy is rewarding for you.
Choose a career
that supports
the way you
would like to live,
or at least one
that supports
your potential
to achieve
your goals.


56 PERSONAL MANAGEMENT
Thinking About Your Future.
Determine the businesses or industries that are likely to
grow and those that are likely to decline by the time you start
your career. This, of course, can be difficult. You can use
information found on the website of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (see the resources section) as a guide to compare
employment trends and projections. Be aware that local trends
might differ from national trends.
Think about where you want to live. Do you like warm or
cold climates? How is the employment market where you
would like to live? You will find that salary ranges vary in
different states for the same types of positions.
Is the career you picked versatile? For instance, if you
have chosen a career in journalism, what other fields would
be open to you if you wanted to make a career change? If you
like writing, for example, you could become a different type
of writer, such as a novelist. Or, while you are in college, you
could take courses that would help you in another field. If you
like government, for example, take government courses along
with journalism courses. By doing that, you might be able to
pursue a career as a professor or a politician if you decided not
to continue as a journalist.
To help decide on a career, work part-time or get an
internship in your chosen field. Firsthand knowledge will give
you better insight into the nature of the career and help make
up your mind.
If you can, talk to people working in the career you would
like to pursue. Ask them about their training and education
and what they would recommend you do to enter the field.
Ask them what they like or dislike about their career and about
the employment outlook for that field. If they do not want to
discuss what they earn, try to determine what they might be
earning by researching the position on the internet and checking
employment advertisements in the local newspaper and online.
You do not have to choose a career right away. In fact,
it probably is best to explore several career possibilities to
find the right one for you. A career is a big part of a person’s
everyday life. It is important to spend that time doing
something you truly enjoy and find worthwhile.
Finding a rewarding career takes thought, creativity, and
hard work. It means setting specific goals for where you want
to be in five, 10, and 20 years. It means investing in yourself
by staying in school or perhaps through retraining or going
back to school. It means taking responsibility for your future.


PERSONAL MANAGEMENT 57
.Thinking About Your Future
The Worthwhile Costs of Education
You and your family might have discussed the costs of going to
college. Earning a college degree can be quite expensive and the costs
rise each year. To get an estimate of what it would cost you, contact the
college you would like to attend and determine the “all-in” cost of
attending for one year, including tuition, books, room and board, and
miscellaneous expenses. This information is usually available on the
college’s website. Multiply that by the number of years you expect to
attend. Factor in yearly cost increases and the likelihood that it will take
longer than four years to earn your degree.
Because college can be expensive, many students seek financial aid
to help pay for expenses. You can earn scholarships through academic or
athletic achievement to help cover a portion of your educational expenses.
You may have to pay for some or all of your education with loans. As an
example, for those students who borrowed from the government, the
average federal student loan debt is now more than $35,000.
Ask your school counselors about scholarships. Numerous
scholarships are available, for different amounts. Also, some
philanthropists provide scholarships and grants. Apply for all scholarships
and grants for which you are eligible, no matter how small. Every little bit
helps. This is especially true since any funds you receive from a grant or
scholarship would lessen the amount you might need to borrow for your
college education.
Websites where you can find information on financial aid are listed
in the resources section of this pamphlet. Be sure to get your parent or
guardian’s permission when you use the internet as a resource. Additional
information about financial aid is available at the library or from your
school counselor. Investigate all possibilities. Most of the information can
be obtained for free.
The U.S. military offers significant educational benefits for its
members after they finish their enlistment. Some people enlist for a
few years specifically to get those educational benefits. Top students
can also get most (or all) of their college educations paid for with ROTC
scholarships or by attending one of the service academies, though those
options also require you to serve as an officer for a few years after college.
Some students help pay for college by working part-time or even
full-time jobs while also attending classes. Juggling all this can make it
difficult to do well in school, but some very motivated students manage to
do so.


58 PERSONAL MANAGEMENT
Thinking About Your Future.
Time Management + Money
Management = Life Management
You may have never considered a career in either time or
money management. But, if you have ever felt a sense of
accomplishment and excitement when you have watched
your money grow, you may want to consider the fascinating
field of money management. If you have ever wondered
who schedules TV programs or determines how long the red
light at a traffic signal should be, then a career related to time
management might be right up your alley.
When we make money grow, we are helping ourselves
live a more secure lifestyle. Financial planners help other peo-
ple do just that by helping them manage their money and pre-
pare for a better and more secure future. For instance, a finan-
cial planner might advise you or your parent or guardian in
both short-term and long-term money or stock plans. It might
not be obvious, but your choices could have a far-reaching
effect, touching the lives of many people directly and indirectly.
In the stock market, you might help another company expand
and create more positions for others to earn a living. In the
banking industry, you might advise your local bank to invest in
its community to foster a better life for those who live there. All
of this can be accomplished by a professional financial planner.
Think about how time management affects your life in
many routine ways—your day-to-day schedule, vacation,
classes at school, religious services. Have you ever been late
or made it in the nick of time to an event? Time managers
plan the schedules for concert halls, stadiums, airline flights,
buses, and trains. They also determine things like how long
the pedestrian crossing light should be. All of these decisions
were made by time specialists who make the science of
time management a career. Time managers and specialists
are our timekeepers, and without them our lives would be
very chaotic.
So, there is no telling where in life the Personal
Management merit badge might lead you.

Insurance
Insurance is often misunderstood. For most people, there are only
two good reasons to buy insurance:
• If it is legally required (such as auto insurance if you drive a
car) or
• If you or your loved ones would bear an unreasonable
financial burden should the insured event(s) occur.
Typical insurance policies have payments that you make
(called premiums), a specific benefit amount that you receive when
you make a claim if the insured event occurs, and a deductible (a
specified amount you must first pay “out of pocket” before the
insurance company pays the benefit).
In order to set its premiums for a particular insurance policy
that you might buy, an insurance company makes its best guess
about how likely the insured event is to happen to you and ensures
that the premium you will pay is high enough to cover the amount
of the benefit payout, on average, plus the company’s overhead
expenses and its profits.
The main reason that most people buy most types of insurance
is because they would need help paying large bills associated with
an insured event. It is possible to buy an insurance policy with a
low deductible that would help you pay small bills. However, such a
policy would be unnecessarily expensive, and many people do not
need help paying small bills.
When you are buying an insurance policy, you should select the
highest deductible that you could afford to pay if you had to. The
benefit of selecting a higher deductible is paying lower premiums.
There are different types of insurance:
• Auto insurance typically covers incidents involving your car
that might cause financial loss, such as property damage,
car repairs, or medical expenses as a result of an accident.
A prudent strategy is to buy the minimum amount of auto
insurance you need and shop around for the best deals
(lowest premiums for identical coverage).
• Disability insurance pays you if you should become disabled
so that you cannot work.
• Health insurance helps you pay medical bills.

.Thinking About Your Future
• Homeowner’s/renter’s insurance covers your home and
possessions against theft, fire, and other incidents that might cause
financial losses to your home or property.
• Life insurance pays out to your loved ones when you die.
Most adults in the U.S. already have life insurance in the form of
Social Security survivor benefits. This may provide enough coverage
by itself.
There are two main types of life insurance: term and whole
life. Term insurance pays a specified amount if you die during the
covered term (for example, a 10-year period). Whole life insurance
pays a specified amount regardless of when you die. Term insurance
costs much less than whole life insurance. Whole life insurance,
however, is aggressively sold by insurance companies because they
make significant profits from selling it. Most people who need life
insurance at all should buy term insurance, shopping around for the
least expensive policy that provides the coverage they need.
