Note to the Counselor
Before assisting Scouts, counselors are strongly encouraged to become familiar with
the Guide to Safe Scouting, which provides an overview of Scouting policies and
procedures. Unit leaders are expected to review the additional reference material cited
prior to conducting certain activities. Counselors can access the Guide to Safe Scouting
online at scouting.org/health-and-safety/gss. The Safe Project Tool Use guidelines can be
found at scouting.org/filestore/healthsafety/pdf/680-028.pdf.
The SAFE Checklist provides general guidelines for keeping participants safe during
activities. To view the full set of guidelines, go to scouting.org/health-and-safety/safe/. The
additional information presented here applies to woodworking activities.
As a reference, the new Guide to Advancement, No. 33088, states:
Those under 18 may not operate machinery or powered woodworking equipment that
is considered hazardous, such as band saws, drill presses, or table and circular saws.
Unless prohibited by state and local law, those under 18 may use handheld tools such
as power drills, screwdrivers, and sanders. Anyone under 18 who uses any power tool
of any size must be supervised by a mature adult experienced in the use of the tool.
Supervision. The Woodwork merit badge counselor should have knowledge of woodwork-
ing equipment, safe industry procedures, and applicable local, state, and federal regulations
regarding woodworking and finishing.
• Counselors should take reasonable measures to ensure all participants are using
tools properly.
Assessment. Hazardous jobs and certain tool and equipment use must be limited to adults at
least 18 years old. Counselors teaching this merit badge must have experience with the tasks
and tools and be recruited to do the work involved. As a rule, Scouting activities may not
include activities for youth that, by law, they would not be allowed to do in the workplace.
It is important also to obey restrictions manufacturers impose or suggest for the use of their
tools or other products, or potentially hazardous chemicals such as paints, stains, lacquers,
etc. See SAFE Project Tool Use at scouting.org/filestore/healthsafety/pdf/680-028.pdf
Fitness. Counselors should be aware of youth participants who may be allergic to wood dust
or particles and finishing supplies.
Equipment and Environment. Counselors should ensure tools are properly sharpened and
well-maintained, and that manufacturers’ operating guides are available when applicable.
• Counselors should take reasonable measures to provide participants with a clutter-free,
well-ventilated work area.
• Counselors should ensure all participants are wearing safety gear for eye protection and
hearing protection, as well as gloves, dust masks, and other protective devices.

.Trees and Wood
Trees and Wood
All the wood around you and all the wood you will
use in your woodworking projects was once part of
a living tree. Trees use water and minerals from the
soil, carbon dioxide from the air, and energy from
sunlight to make wood.
Wood is an amazingly versatile, practical, yet
beautiful material. It can become a roof over our
heads, a floor beneath our feet, a fun toy or piece
of art, a musical instrument—just about anything.
As a woodworker or carpenter, you will find no end of useful,
valuable, and fun items you can make yourself, from wood.
The grain of wood is its pattern of lines, curves, and shad-
ings. The grain pattern is caused by the tree’s growth. Usually
the grain runs lengthwise in boards. The grain showing at either
end of a board is called end grain. The wide surface of a board
is its face, the narrow surface its edge.
Kinds of Wood
A good way to start on the Woodwork merit badge is to collect
and label blocks of six kinds of wood useful in woodworking.
You may be able to get small samples from a carpenter, cabinet-
maker, lumberyard, building center, or home project center.
Scavenge for scrap wood from the garage or workshop of a
family member or friend. (No matter how small the scrap, ask
before taking it.)
Wood is divided into two main groups. Hardwoods
come from broadleaf trees, which usually lose their leaves in
autumn. Hardwoods include oak, ash, hickory, maple, tulip
tree, sweet gum, birch, tupelo, aspen, walnut, cherry, and
beech. Softwoods come from trees called conifers, which have
waxy needles or scalelike leaves that they keep through the
winter. For this reason, they are also called evergreens. Pines,
Douglas fir, Western true firs, hemlock, redwood, spruce, and
cedars are softwoods.

.Trees and Wood
Plywood and Veneers
One of the most useful materials in woodworking is plywood,
a sandwich of three or more thin sheets of wood. The sheets,
called veneers, are glued and pressed together, with the grain
directions alternating, to form one solid sheet. This arrange-
ment makes plywood strong.
You can buy plywood that has a face veneer, or thin
outside sheet, of fine wood such as mahogany or walnut.
This gives an expensive look that is less costly. Plywood and
veneers are widely used in construction and in cabinetmaking.
If you use a piece of plywood as one of your samples for
requirement 2(b), be sure you know what wood is used for the
face veneer.

.Timber and Lumber
Timber and Lumber
Standing trees and their wood are called timber. Timber cut
and prepared for use is lumber. In the United States, timber is
harvested from public (national and state) forests and from
private forests owned by companies that manufacture lumber,
paper, and other wood products. Foresters grow and harvest
crops of trees much as farmers raise corn, wheat, or other crops.
Field crops ripen in a year or less. Trees, however, may
grow for five to 30 years or longer before they are ready
for cutting. Growing and harvesting timber takes patience.
Planting Trees
Timber may grow from seeds or from seedlings. To scatter
seeds on forest land, airplanes or helicopters generally are
used. But people working with hand tools may also plant tree
seeds in the ground.
Seedlings (young trees) are raised in a nursery
for one to four years before being transplanted to the
forest. Foresters use hand tools or planting machines
to plant seedlings.
Harvesting Timber
The four main methods of harvesting timber are
selection cutting, shelterwood cutting, clear-cutting,
and seed tree cutting.
Selection Cutting. Harvesters take small patches
of mature trees—usually trees that are large and
growing near others— to make room for younger
trees to grow. Foresters leave many larger trees in
place, however, to make seeds. Forests may be
harvested by selection cutting every five to 30 years.
American beech, sugar maple, and hemlock are trees
typically harvested by this method.
For more
about forest
management, see
the Forestry merit
badge pamphlet.
Selection cutting


12 WOODWORK
Timber and Lumber.
Shelterwood Cutting. A stand (area) of timber is harvested in
stages over a span of 10 to 20 years. Foresters plant new trees
where the mature ones are cut down. This method is called
“shelterwood” because the trees left standing provide shelter
(shade) for the newly planted trees. Some trees, such as oak,
ponderosa pine, and white pine, need shade during their early
growing years.
Clear-cutting. Clear-cutting is removing all the trees from a
section of forest. Clear-cut areas can be a few acres or hun-
dreds of acres large. Foresters may replant the area, or new
trees sprout from the stumps of the old ones. The seedlings
that replace the harvested trees grow in full sunlight. They
produce a stand of trees all the same age.
Seed Tree Cutting. This method resembles clear-cutting,
except a few trees are left scattered through the cutover area
as a natural source of seeds. Loblolly pine, longleaf pine, and
other southern pines can be grown using this method.

WOODWORK 13
.Timber and Lumber
Milling Lumber
Loggers cut down trees that foresters have marked for cutting.
Then workers called buckers lop off the limbs and slice the
trunks into shorter lengths (logs) that are easier to handle.
The logs are trucked, floated, or carried on railroads to a
sawmill. At the mill, logs are debarked (their bark is removed),
and saws cut them into boards (lumber).
Small logs are often cut into boards in a single pass through
a set of saws (a gang saw) that makes many cuts at once. Large
logs may make several passes through one saw (a headsaw) that
slices off a board at a time until the whole log is cut into lumber.
The new lumber, called green lumber, is edged and trimmed to
straighten the sides and cut into boards of standard lengths.
Grading Lumber
Lumber is graded for quality, appearance, and strength. In
the case of hardwoods, the amount of usable wood or “clear”
wood (wood without defects such as knots, holes, or splits)
determines the grade of a piece of lumber.
Large and small logs are sawed in various patterns to get as
much lumber as possible from each log.
Headsaw
If you use
hardwood in your
woodworking
projects, it
probably will
be graded FAS,
Selects, or
No. 1 Common.
Woodworkers
seldom see the
lower grades.
Manufacturers
use them to
make flooring,
pallets, and
similar products.


14 WOODWORK
Timber and Lumber.
HARDWOOD GRADES
The seven grades of hardwood lumber, from highest to lowest, are
Firsts and Seconds (FAS), Selects, No. 1 Common, No. 2 Common,
No. 3A Common, No. 3B Common, and Sound Wormy.
SOFTWOOD GRADES
For softwoods, there are almost as many grading systems as
there are kinds of wood. All systems, however, follow the basic
rule that the fewer the blemishes and the nicer the color and
grain, the better and more expensive the wood. The top grades
(“A” or “No. 1”) have practically no defects. The middle grades
may have a few knots and some variations in color. The lowest
grades (usually “D,” “No. 4,” or “No. 5”) may have large knots
and even knotholes.
Here are some of the softwood grades you may find at a
lumberyard or building center.
Appearance graded lumber is for interior trim, paneling,
flooring, cabinetwork, and the like. The grades are shown by
letters: A, B, C, D, and combination grades such as “B and
better” (“B&B” or “B&BTR”) and “C and better” (“C&BTR”).
Depending on the kind of wood, appearance grades may also
be called “Select,” “Finish,” “Superior,” “Prime,” or “Clear.”
Nonstress-graded (common) lumber is used where strength
is not crucial for safety. Boards in this group are often used
for siding, shelving, and paneling. The grades for this
“common lumber” may be numbered or named, as No. 1
(Construction), No. 2 (Standard), No. 3 (Utility), or No. 4
and No. 5 (Economy).
Stress-graded (dimension) lumber is structural lumber
graded according to the load it can carry. Structural lumber
(referred to as “dimension” lumber) must be strong for use as
posts, beams, studs, and rafters. The grades for dimension lum-
ber (2" x 4" and wider) range from Select Structural (abbrevi-
ated SEL STR) through Nos. 1–3 and Construction, Standard,
and Utility.
The term yard lumber is often used for the nonstress-graded and
appearance lumber sold in lumberyards. This is the type of softwood
lumber many woodworkers use.


WOODWORK 15
.Timber and Lumber
PLYWOOD GRADES
Plywood comes in three grades. Rough plywood is rough to
the touch, knotty, and the least expensive. Finish plywood
is smoother, with a finer surface. It costs more than rough
plywood. Exterior-grade plywood is made especially for use
outdoors. Waterproof glue keeps its layers from separating or
buckling if the wood gets wet.
Seasoning Lumber
To season (or cure) lumber is to dry it. Wood will warp if too
much moisture is left in it. Some lumber is seasoned by air
drying. It’s stacked outdoors to dry by sun and wind. Kiln
drying is quicker. Green lumber goes into drying sheds, or
kilns, where the temperature and the moisture in the air are
controlled. Blowers in the shed circulate warm air, drying the
lumber with more consistency in a few days than would be
possible during months of air drying.
MILL IDENTIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION
This will vary from place to place.
TREE SPECIES
(Here, hemlock-fir)
MOISTURE CONTENT
S-DRY means “surfaced (when) dry”; that is,
when the lumber was surfaced, the moisture
content was less than 19 percent. S-GRN
(“surfaced green”) means the moisture content
was more than 19 percent. Other markings
could include KD, for “kiln dried,” and PAD,
for “partially air dried.”
LUMBER GRADE
For remodeling projects, most homeowners
will use SEL STR (Select Structural) or
Nos. 1 through 3.

16 WOODWORK
Timber and Lumber.
Sizing Lumber
Lumber comes in standard sizes, with the thickness and width
measured in inches and the length in feet. Lumber is measured
before it is seasoned and surfaced (made smooth). Lumber
shrinks as it dries, and smoothing the surface also makes the
finished pieces smaller than their nominal (named) size.
Therefore, if you go to a building center or lumberyard
and ask for an 8-foot “two-by-four,” should you expect to get a
piece of lumber that is 8 feet long, 2 inches thick, and 4 inches
wide? No. The two-by-four will be a full 8 feet long. Even
though the actual thickness and width of the board may be
only 11/2" x 31/2", it still is called a “two-by-four.”
Standard lumber sizes vary depending on moisture con-
tent and the type of wood. Hardwood is sold in lengths that
can be divided evenly into 1-foot sections. Softwood struc-
tural lumber is sold in lengths divisible into 2-foot sections.
Dimension lumber is typically 2 inches thick and up to 12
inches wide. (The two-by-four in the above example is dimen-
sion lumber.) Board lumber is typically 1 inch thick and up
to 12 inches wide. Timbers (defined in this sense as “large
squared pieces of wood”) measure 5 or more inches thick.
Standard Sizes of Wood
Nominal Size Actual Thickness Actual Width
1" x 4" 3/4" 31/2"
2" x 4" 11/2" 31/2"
1" x 6" 3/4" 51/2"
1" x 12" 3/4" 111/4" or 111/2"
These are some common lumber sizes you may use in your projects.
Wood comes in other standard sizes. Take a tape measure on your
next trip to the lumberyard or building center and check the actual
dimensions and nominal sizes of the lumber sold there.


WOODWORK 17
.Timber and Lumber
Composite Woods
Composite woods are made from wood and at least one other
material. Most are made by combining wood or bits of wood
with an adhesive resin or glue.
In your woodworking projects, you may use some of these
composite woods:
• Plywood—made from plies (veneers or layers) of wood
glued together
• Particleboard—made from wood flakes, shavings, and
similar particles of wood glued together with synthetic resin
and pressed into stable sheets
• Medium density fiberboard (MDF)—made from fine,
individual wood fibers or fiber bundles bonded with adhesive
to give a smooth, flat face and clean, easily workable edges
• Oriented strandboard (OSB)—made from thin strands of
wood that are glued and pressed into a solid panel
• Hardboard—made from wood pulp and particles that are
squeezed, glued, and dried into panels with a density higher
than particleboard or MDF
The panel products usually are sold in 4' x 8' sheets, 1/8 inch
and up in thickness. Some plywoods are 3/4 inch and even
thicker. Plywood up to 3/8 inch usually has three plies or layers.
Thicker plywoods have five or sometimes seven layers.
Woodworkers and carpenters sometimes use another measurement
of wood, called a board foot. To find out how many board feet are in
a piece of lumber, multiply the length of the lumber (in feet) by the
thickness (in inches) by the width (in feet). If you know the width in
inches, divide by 12 to convert to feet.
For example, to figure the board feet in a 10-foot 1" x 6":
10' x 1" x 6/12 = 5 board feet
Now you try it. How many board feet are in an 8-foot 2" x 4"?
8' x 2" x 4/12 = ? (Find the answer at the end of this chapter.)
How many board feet are in an 8-foot 2" x 4"?
8' x 2" x 4/12 = 5.33 board feet

Tools and How to
Use Them
Learn the skillful and safe use of your woodworking tools. Learn
to use the right tool for the job—it makes working with wood
easier, safer, and faster. And learn to take care of tools to keep
them working longer. This chapter gives you a rundown on
useful tools and how to select, use, and care for them correctly
and safely.
Measuring and Leveling Tools
A rule is essential for measuring wood. A folding rule is a
collapsible, usually 6-foot, rigid wooden ruler. A steel tape
measure has a flexible metal blade, 16 feet to 33 feet or
longer, that rolls up in a case. For small jobs, you may use
a yardstick or a common 12-inch ruler.
How to Use a Rule
Lay a rule on edge so that the marks showing divisions of inches
are flush against the wood. Use a plain soft-lead pencil to mark
measurements. The wide lead of carpenter’s pencils makes too broad
a mark. Mark a measurement not with a dot but with a dash going in
the direction of the cutting line you plan to draw.

Squares are for marking or checking right
angles. A try square is shaped like an L with
a perfect 90-degree (right) angle. Often made
with a metal blade and a wooden handle, a
try square is used to check that corners are
square and edges are straight.
How to Use a Try Square
Hold a try square’s thick handle against one
edge of a board so that the thin blade hooks
over the board’s end. If the end of the board
doesn’t align precisely with the edge of the
blade, the board isn’t square.
To square the board, hold the try
square’s handle firmly against one edge
of the board so that the metal blade lies
flat across the board’s face, about 2 inches
from the crooked end. Pencil a line along
the blade from edge to edge of the board.
Lay the board on your workbench or other work surface, making sure
that the pencil line clears the edge of the bench by about 2 inches.
Clamp the board to the bench. Saw along the pencil line to remove the
board’s crooked end.

WOODWORK 21
.Tools and How to Use Them
The larger, all-metal carpenter’s square,
also called a framing square, can be used
to mark boards that are too broad for the
try square.
The combination square has a movable
handle that locks in place on its 12-inch steel
rule. It can be used like a try square to square
the end of a board. Or it can be used to mark
a 45-degree angle (half of 90 degrees).
A level is used for checking whether a
board, shelf, or other work piece is exactly
level (horizontal) or plumb (vertical;
straight up and down). Another tool for
checking verticality is the plumb line,
which is a string with a weight on its end.
When a plumb line hangs freely, it makes
an exactly vertical line.

Fastening Tools
Hammers come in many styles and
sizes. A basic claw hammer has a
forked, curved end opposite the head.
A 10-ounce claw hammer or one not
much heavier may be your best choice.
How to Use a Hammer
To start a nail, hold the nail by the shank (the straight
part), well below the head. Lightly tap the head two or
three times so the nail is driven just far enough into the
wood to stand by itself. Then move your hand clear.
To drive the nail deeper, swing your arm at the
elbow, hit the nail head squarely, and hammer only until
the head is flush with the surface of the wood. Any farther
and the head of the hammer may damage the wood surface.
To remove a bent nail, use the forked end of a claw
hammer. Hold the hammer upside down and slide the
notch of the fork under the head of the nail. Use a block of scrap
wood under the
hammer’s head if
you need to raise
the hammer high
enough for the
claws to catch the
nail head. Then pull
back on the handle
to pull the nail
from the wood.

WOODWORK 23
.Tools and How to Use Them
How to Use a Nail Set
A nail set is used most often with thin, small-headed nails, called
finishing nails, for projects that will be stained and varnished rather
than painted. Drive a finishing nail as close to the wood surface as you
can without denting the wood with the hammer. Then place the nail set
on the nail head and tap the head below the surface. Fill the hole with
wood filler to hide the nail.
A nail set is a tapered
metal tool used to
drive nails below the
surface of wood.
Prevention goes hand in hand with mitigation, which means “to lessen
in force or intensity” and “to make less severe.” By taking precautions
to manage risk and the possibility of injury, you can be prepared to
anticipate, help prevent, mitigate, and respond to just about any
incident that might happen during woodworking projects.


24 WOODWORK
Tools and How to Use Them.
A mallet is a hammer with a head usually made of wood or
rubber and is used for hitting wood but never for driving nails.
If you have to tap dowels in using a claw hammer, be careful
not to split the wood.
Screwdrivers come in two main different types. A standard
screwdriver has a flat tip or blade for driving single-slotted
screws. A Phillips screwdriver has a cross-shaped tip for driving
cross-slotted screws.
Screws also have different shapes of heads: flat, round, or
oval. You will probably use flathead wood screws most. They
can be seated so the head is flush (level) with the wood sur-
face. Or they can be countersunk (driven below the surface)
and filled over to hide the head.
Common nails, for general construction work, have
large, round, flat heads. Box nails have a narrower
shank and are used to avoid splitting thin wood.
See “Nail Types” and “Nail Sizes” in the Home
Repairs merit badge pamphlet.
How to Use a Screwdriver
Match the screwdriver to the screw. Use the right tip,
and also the correct size. A blade too thick won’t fit
in the screw slot. A blade too wide may scratch the
wood surface. A blade too narrow can twist in the
screw slot, slip out, and gouge the wood or stab you.

Wood hand-screw clamps are useful for holding pieces of
wood together while you join them with nails, screws, or glue.
Clamps also secure wood to a workbench or table. In place of
clamps, use a vise attached to a workbench.
How to Use a Clamp
Always secure wood, using clamps or a vise as needed, before cutting
or otherwise working with it. If you use a machinist’s vise, use scrap
wood to protect your good wood from the vise’s teeth.

Cutting Tools
A ripsaw is for cutting a piece of wood lengthwise, in the direc-
tion of the grain. A crosscut saw is for cutting across the grain,
as when you saw the end off a board. A backsaw, which has a
thin blade stiffened by a metal bar along its back, is for precise
cutting and fine work, such as joinery.
Japanese Saws
A conventional handsaw, which
cuts on the push stroke, has a
fairly thick blade to withstand
the pushing force. Japanese
saws, in contrast, cut on the
pull stroke. Because there is
less strain on them, the blades won’t buckle and can be thinner. A thin
blade cuts faster, with less effort, and more control. If pull-stroke saws
are available to you, try them. Like many other woodworkers, you
may find them easier to use than ordinary handsaws.

How to
Use a Rasp
A rasp works only
as it’s moving
forward. Push it
across the surface
to be smoothed,
and then pick it up
and bring it back.
How to
Use a
Coping Saw
To make a cutout in
a piece of wood, first
bore a hole, 1/4" or
larger, just inside the
shape you want to
cut out. Remove the
blade of the coping
saw, slip the blade
through the bored
hole, and replace
the blade in the saw
frame. With the blade
thus “inside” the
wood, saw along the
cutting line.
A coping saw is good for cutting curves. Its thin, replaceable blade can be angled.
A rasp has sharp
teeth for smoothing
rough surfaces.


28 WOODWORK
Tools and How to Use Them.
Chisels have strong, square, flat blades with beveled (slanting)
edges for shaving and shaping wood. The wedge of a chisel’s
blade cuts and lifts unwanted wood out of the way.
Planes are for smoothing and straightening rough or uneven
surfaces, or for shaving extra thickness or width from a piece
of wood. A smoothing plane is the most common. The longer
jack plane is for planing long pieces of wood. A block plane,
the shortest, is for smoothing the end grain or trimming small
pieces of wood. A block plane is normally held and used with
one hand.
Use a chisel to pare out wood for a hinge.
How to Use a Chisel
Do not cut too deeply. Chisels are
meant to chip and shave away wood.
Start the blade digging gently into
the wood, slightly inside your
guideline mark. If you need to use
more pressure than you can apply
by hand, tap the chisel’s handle with
a wooden mallet. Always aim the
cutting edge away from your body
and hands.
Vary the downward pressure when you plane a board.
A block plane
can be used for
beveling edges.
See project 5 for a
picture of a bevel.

.Tools and How to Use Them
Drilling Tools
Drills hold bits (sharp metal points) to bore holes in wood.
A hand drill holds cutting bits or twist drills for making holes
up to 1/4 inch in diameter. A brace, with its larger bits called
auger bits, bores larger holes.
How to Use a Drill
Always drill with straight-in (not sideways)
pressure to avoid bending or breaking the bit.
To eliminate splintering when using a brace
and bit, drill through one side of the wood
until the tip of the bit shows, and then turn
the wood over and bore from the other side
to finish the hole.
In modern workshops, electric drills have largely
replaced the traditional brace and bit. For require-
ment 4, however, you are to use a brace and bit even
if you have an electric drill available. Using a brace
and bit helps you understand the qualities of the
wood you are working.
How to Use a Plane
Secure the wood with a vise or
clamps. Hold the plane with a hand
on the handle and a hand on the
knob. Push the plane firmly along
the entire length of the wood with-
out lifting it off the surface. Then
raise the plane and move it back to the starting position. When starting
cuts, apply more pressure to the front of the plane. When completing
cuts, apply more pressure to the back.
Plane with (not against) the grain of the wood. If the plane sticks,
digs in, or lifts chips of the wood, you are probably planing against
the grain. Turn the wood around in the vise. Make sure only a little of
the cutting blade sticks out of the base plate. Too much blade makes
the plane hard to use and may damage the wood. Use a sharp blade.
When you aren’t using a plane, rest it on its sole to avoid damage to
the blade.

Tools and How to Use Them.
How to Use an Electric Drill
To start a hole,
push the point of a
nail into the wood
to make a small
dent. The dent will
help keep the drill
bit from skittering
across the wood as
you begin drilling.
Put a thick piece of
scrap wood under
the drilling area to
prevent damage to
your workbench or
table, in case the
bit breaks through the underside of the wood you
are drilling.
Let the drill do the drilling. Don’t
apply excessive pressure. Keep
the drill running as you finish the
hole and gently pull the bit out.
Otherwise the bit may bind (stick in
the hole) and you could bend or break
the bit trying to get it free.
Electric drill
A popular size of electric drill is 3
⁄8 inch. It will accept
bits in common sizes from 1
⁄16 inch up.
Use power tools
only with constant
and responsible
adult supervision.
Power tools
are potentially
dangerous tools.

A type of power sander popular with woodworkers is
the orbital sander, sometimes called a pad sander. It has a flat
sanding base that moves with short, quick strokes.
How to Use an Orbital Sander
Wear a dust mask. Do not press down on the sander. Let the tool’s own
weight do the sanding. To avoid gouging the wood, don’t start or stop
a power sander while it is on the wood. Keep the machine running as
you set it down or lift it off. Keep the sander constantly moving over
the wood’s surface. Whenever possible, sand with the grain. Start with
coarse sandpaper and finish with a fine paper.


WOODWORK 33
.Tools and How to Use Them
Safety Pointers
Tools designed for cutting, drilling, and shaping wood can slice
through flesh in an instant. In addition, power tools can cause
severe burns and electrical shock.
Keep yourself safe. Learn and take these precautions. (See
additional safety tips in the Home Repairs merit badge pamphlet.)
Equipment and Clothing
• Always wear safety glasses
when hammering, chiseling,
or sanding or when using
power tools.
• Wear hearing protectors when
using power tools. Many power
tools are noisy enough to damage
your hearing.
• When sanding, sawing, or doing
any work that produces wood
dust, wear a disposable dust
mask to avoid breathing sawdust.
• Don’t wear loose clothing or
jewelry that could catch in moving parts. Tie back long hair.
• Indoors, use glues, adhesives, paints, varnishes, etc., only
with proper ventilation. Wear a face mask or respirator for
protection against toxic fumes.
More Tool Care Tips
• Keep your tools clean and properly lubricated.
A film of rust-inhibiting oil will help protect tools
from corrosion.
• Store metal tools safely indoors, never outside.
• Store tools out of the way when you aren’t using
them. Have a secure place for every tool and
keep it in its place. Tools left lying around can
get broken or pose a danger.


34 WOODWORK
Tools and How to Use Them.
Materials and Procedures
• Secure wood—using clamps or a vise as needed—before
drilling, cutting, or shaping it. When you saw a board,
be sure both of its ends are well-supported (on a pair of
sawhorses, for example). Don’t cut between the supports.
• Keep your hands clear of blades, bits, and other cutting
edges or moving parts.
• Never remove guards from machinery.
• Never use a power tool in wet or damp areas.
• Properly ground power tools. Plug them into three-hole
grounded outlets.
General Safety
• Always work away from your body; that is, never point a sharp
object, such as a screwdriver or chisel, toward you as you work.
• Always unplug power tools before changing their settings
or parts. Keep a tool’s adjustment key(s) taped to the power
cord near the plug. This saves keys from getting lost and
also reminds you to unplug the tool before you adjust it.
• Keep power cords away from blades, and otherwise make
sure that the cord doesn’t hinder the tool’s operation.
• Keep a firm grip on handheld power tools. They can get
away from you if you are not in control.
• Watch what you are doing. Stop your work if something
distracts you. Don’t work with tools if you are tired or sleepy.
Always work under the supervision of a responsible adult,
like your parent or guardian, who knows how to operate the
tools you will be using.


WOODWORK 35
.Tools and How to Use Them
First Aid
Keep a first-aid kit on hand and know what to do for injuries
that could occur while woodworking. The following is a quick
review of the basics. For details, see the First Aid merit badge
pamphlet and the Scouts BSA handbook.
Remove splinters with tweezers. Encourage the wound to
bleed to flush out foreign matter. Wash with soap and water.
Apply antiseptic. Cover with an adhesive bandage.
Wash scratches and
minor cuts with soap and
water. Apply antiseptic. Cover
with an adhesive bandage.
For an object in the
eye, do not rub the eye. Make
tears flow by blinking or flush
the eye with water to wash
away the object. To remove
an object from the white part
of the eye, use the corner of
a clean cloth or handkerchief.
Do not try to take out some-
thing that is stuck in the eye.
Cover the injured eye with
a dry, sterile gauze pad and
seek medical attention.
For severe bleeding,
apply direct pressure to the
wound. Raise the injury above the level of the heart. Seek
medical help.
For burns, place in cold or cool water to reduce pain. Let
the burn dry, and then protect it with a sterile gauze pad. If
blisters form, do not break them. Do not apply butter, creams,
ointments, or sprays. In the case of third-degree (severe) burns,
treat for shock and seek immediate medical attention.
In case of electric shock, pull the plug or shut off the
power at the main switch or breaker box. Do not directly touch
a live wire or anyone in contact with a live current. Use a dry
cloth to pull a live wire from a victim. To drag someone clear,
use a cloth to pull the victim far enough to break contact.
Then, if the person is not breathing, give rescue breathing
(see the First Aid merit badge pamphlet). Send for emergency
medical assistance.


36 WOODWORK
Tools and How to Use Them.
Sharpening Cutting Edges
Keep the blades sharp on all your cutting tools. Dull blades are
hard to use. You are more likely to mar your work and injure
yourself with a dull blade than a sharp one because dull blades
require extra force and can slip.
Most wood-cutting tools have two wedge
shapes on their cutting edge: the main or ground
bevel, and the sharpening bevel. When you are
sharpening an edge, you should be working off the
sharpening bevel only, not the larger ground bevel.
When sharpening a blade, start with a rough
stone, followed by (in this order and as needed)
a medium, fine, and smooth stone. Finish with a
piece of leather, commonly called a leather strop.
(For more about sharpening stones and leather
strops, see the Wood Carving merit badge pamphlet.)
Sharpening a Plane
Take the plane apart and remove the cutting iron or
blade. Lay the iron facedown on a whetstone. Then
raise it slowly until you feel that it “fits”; that is,
until you are sure both heel and toe (front and
back) of the cutting edge are on the stone.
The sharpening angle must be parallel to
the stone. Whet the edge by pushing it
forward over the stone.
To finish, turn the blade over on
its flat side and, keeping the back flat
on the stone, push it forward. Stoning
both sides produces a little wiry burr
on the edge. Remove the burr or wire
edge by stropping on a piece of leather.
Never throw tools into a toolbox. Rough handling
will nick and dull the cutting edges.

.Tools and How to Use Them
Sharpening a Chisel
Use the same technique to sharpen a chisel, making sure you
keep a constant angle as you push the chisel forward over the
stone. You may tend to roll your hand, but it’s vital to maintain
the same angle. Pull the chisel back toward you with a light
return stroke; apply no pressure. Stone both sides, and then
remove the wire edge (burr) by stropping.
The Totin’ Chip
For Woodwork requirement 1(b) you are to earn the Totin’ Chip, which
grants you the right to carry and use woods tools. See the Scouts BSA
handbook for details.
Turn the chisel over on its flat side
and keep it absolutely flat as you
stone the back.
When you find the correct angle,
remember it and keep it constant.This is to certify that the bearer
has read the woods tools use and safety rules from
the “Tools“ chapter of the Scouts BSA handbook.
This Scout knows that the ownership or use of
woods tools means responsibility, and accepts it.
In consideration of the above, this Scout is hereby
granted “Totin’ Rights.”

Steps for Making the
Bench Hook
1. Check the 1" x 8" board for
square. Square the board if
necessary, as described in the
previous section.
2. Measure 8" from the squared
end and mark a point. Using
the try square to guide your
pencil, draw a line across
the board’s face, through
the 8" mark.
3. Clamp the board to steady it.
Saw along the pencil line. Set
aside this 8" piece; it will be
the base of your bench hook.
4. Square one end of the 1" x 2"
board. From the squared
board, measure, mark, and
cut two strips 7" long.
5. On each strip, measure and
mark the centers for two
holes. The holes should be
21/4" from each end and
centered in the inch-and-a-
half width of each strip, as
shown in the drawing.

6. Lay a strip on the face of the
8" base piece. Align the
strip’s edge and one end
flush with the base’s edge
and end, as shown.
7. Clamp the stacked pieces
(7a) to your workbench
(being sure to sandwich
scrap wood between the
base and the bench to pro-
tect your work surface). As
you tighten the clamp, keep
the base and strip properly
aligned, with their ends and
edges flush. Then use your
brace and 3/8" bit to care-
fully drill each hole (7b).
Drill completely through the
strip and through the base,
into the scrap wood beneath.
8. Unclamp the stacked pieces.
Label and set aside the
drilled strip (strip No. 1).
Turn the base over.
9. Repeat steps 6 and 7, drill-
ing through strip No. 2 and
through the base at the
opposite edge of the base.

WOODWORK 41
.Project 1: Make a Bench Hook
10. From a 3/8" dowel, cut four pieces, each
2" long.
11. Dry-fit the dowels. That is, try pushing them
into the drilled holes to check for a snug
fit, but do not push them so far in that you
can’t remove them. Pull them out before
going to the next step.
12. Brush a little wood glue into the first two
holes you drilled in the base (not too much
glue—the excess will squeeze out). Spread
a little glue on the bottom inch of a dowel.
Insert the glued end of the dowel into a hole,
and use a mallet to tap the dowel into place.
Then glue and tap the bottom inch of a
second dowel into the other prepared hole.
13. Using a brush, spread a thin layer of glue on
the face of the base where strip No. 1 will sit.
Brush glue onto the dowels that are sticking
up from the base. Spread a layer of glue on
the underside of the strip and inside the two
holes in the strip.
14. With your hammer or mallet, tap the strip
down over the two dowels (14a) until the
underside of the strip is tight against the face
of the base. The ends of the dowels should
stick out of the holes a short way (14b). You
made the dowels 2" long, and the combined
thickness of the base and the strip is only
11/2" (3/4" plus 3/4").

15. Wipe away the excess glue while it is
still wet.
16. Turn the base over.
17. Repeat steps 11 through 15 to fasten
strip No. 2 to the other side of the
base. The two strips must be on
opposite faces of the base, as well
as on opposite edges, as shown in
the drawing.
18. Clamp each strip to the base while
the glue is drying. Allow the glue to
dry completely before removing the
clamps. (The photo shows only one
strip in place.)
19. Finally, use a block plane to shave
off the ends of the dowels that are
sticking out of the holes.
Using Your Bench Hook
1. Put the bench hook on your work table
so that strip No. 2 (the front strip)
hooks over the table’s front edge.
2. Lay a new board (lumber you intend
to cut) on the bench hook’s base.
3. Push the board’s long edge up
against strip No. 1 (the back strip).
Be sure the end of the board hangs
past the edge of the bench hook (and
the edge of your work table) so you
have room to saw.
4. Using the heel of your free hand,
push the board tightly against the
bench hook’s back strip as you use
your other hand to saw. Your bench
hook will help you hold the board
much steadier than you could hold it
by hand alone.

Glues and Adhesives
Woodworkers often use adhesives along with dowels, screws, nails, or
other fasteners. Here are a few common types.
• Polyvinyl (carpenter’s wood) glue is used mainly for furniture, craft,
or general woodworking projects. It dries clear and won’t stain, but
it won’t withstand water.
• Resorcinol and formaldehyde adhesive comes as two parts that
must be mixed before using. Resorcinol glue is waterproof and
heat resistant.
• Contact cements are used to bond veneers or to bond plastic
laminates to wood for tabletops and counters. Align the surfaces
perfectly before pressing them together because this adhesive will
not pull apart.
• Epoxy resists almost anything, from water to solvents. Before using
epoxy, as with all glues and adhesives, read the directions carefully.
Follow instructions on how to mix the resin and the hardener and
how long the mixture remains workable before it hardens.

3. Clamp the board to a secure work surface,
making sure the pencil line clears the edge
of the surface. With a ripsaw, saw off
excess wood. Cut a little outside the pencil
line, not exactly alongside it.
4. Turn the board so that the freshly cut edge
is up. Secure it with clamps or in a vise.
Plane the sawed edge lengthwise, removing
wood down to the line.
5. Lay the board flat and check it for square.
If necessary, square off one end.
Sawing and planing to the pencil line
will give you a 4"-wide board with

Insetting Hinges
Woodworkers and carpenters use many types of
hinges, including T hinges, strap hinges, piano hinges,
and butt hinges. In this pamphlet we deal only with
butt hinges, one of the most popular types.
To install hinges, begin by setting the door
or lid carefully into place. Position the hinges and
mark the location on both the door or lid and on the
frame or panel to which the hinges will attach. Mark
the depth and width of the gain—the notch into
which the hinge leaf fits.
Hold a chisel straight up and down with its
blade just inside the cutting mark. Tap the chisel
with a wooden mallet all along the mark to score
(groove) the cutting line. Then chisel out the gain.
The best way is to make a series of cuts with the
chisel in the direction of the grain of the wood, by
lightly tapping the chisel with a mallet. Then use a
wide chisel to pare out the bottom of the gain.
When you have made the gains for each hinge,
fasten the hinges with screws. It is a good idea to
put only one screw in each hinge until you are sure
no further fitting will be necessary. Then put in the
remaining screws.

Project 4: Create
Your Own
For requirement 5, you are to create your own woodworking
project. Think of something fun to make or an item you want or
need. A tool rack? Doghouse? Bird feeder?
Working Drawings
Whatever it is, start by sketching it out. Make the sort of working
drawings you have used for the projects you have already built.
As you have seen, working drawings are fairly detailed and
accurate sketches of a project. They show the dimensions for
each piece and how the pieces fit together.
Some working drawings show only two views, the front
and the top or the front and one side. Others have three
views—top, front, and side. For your project, show as many
views as you need to fully visualize the project, its dimensions,
and how to cut and assemble the pieces.

The sample bill of materials below lists everything needed (except
fasteners—nails or screws) to build the tool rack illustrated.

Bill of Materials
Also list the materials you will need. Your list (called a bill of
materials) should show the sizes and lengths of all lumber
required, as well as any hardware needed, such as hinges, hasps,
locks, and knobs. Make up this bill of materials carefully. It will
be your shopping list at the lumberyard or building center, and
the best way of keeping track of the cost of the materials you use.
Recordkeeping
As you design and then build your project, keep track of the
hours and money you spend, and keep your receipts. Record
this information. Woodworkers would not know how much
to charge for their work if they had no record of their time or
costs. Although you aren’t doing this work for pay, it’s still a
good idea (and for requirement 5, it’s a must) to get into the
habit of keeping good records.

Project 5: Fine Woodworking.
Project 5: Fine
Woodworking
The projects you have completed up
to now probably have not called for
much fine woodworking. Fulfilling
requirement 6 gives you the chance
to learn some of the more advanced
skills that carpenters and cabinet-
makers use.
Beveled and Rounded Edges
A bevel is an angle cut in a board, either to make it look bet-
ter or to fit the board properly against another piece. A bevel is
made by shaving the wood with a smoothing plane or block
plane. Begin by drawing a line on the wood to show the
angle to be cut. Then secure the piece in a vise and plane
away the excess wood. Check your work frequently to make
sure you are not planing too much.
Rounding an edge is simply another step beyond beveling.
Instead of leaving a sharp edge, plane it down to a rounded
shape. Then sand the edge to smooth and further round it,
being sure to sand with the wood’s grain.
Curved and Incised Cuttings
Some projects may call for cutting wood in curved
or irregular shapes or making incised (deeply and
sharply notched) cuttings in the edges of the wood.
As you have learned already, a coping saw is good
for making curved cuts.
This sketch shows a rack for
holding a baseball bat, balls,
and mitts.

.Project 5: Fine Woodworking
Joints
The most familiar way to join two pieces of wood is
the butt joint, in which the pieces are simply butted
together at right angles and held by nails, screws, or
some other type of fastener. You have made several
butt joints in your projects so far.
If you built the bench hook, you have also made a
face joint. A face joint is two boards fastened together
so that their faces are flat against each other. Here are
some other types of joints that woodworkers use.
Miter Joint
The angled miter joint is especially useful where two
pieces come together at a corner and you do not want
the end grain of either piece to show. Miter joints are
used on picture frames, trims, door moldings, and
similar projects where appearance counts.
For a joint in which the two pieces make a square
corner (an angle of 90 degrees, also called a right
angle), each piece must be cut to a 45-degree angle.
To make precise cuts use a miter box, which has slits
for guiding the saw at exactly the correct angle.
Butt joint
Face joint
A miter joint, even when nailed, is not very strong. To reinforce it, woodworkers often
use a corner brace made of metal, or a wooden spline. A spline is a thin, flat piece
of wood that is glued into grooves in the two pieces being joined. The spline adds
strength to the joint.
Miter joint


60 WOODWORK
Project 5: Fine Woodworking.
Dowel Joint
Dowels can be used as fasteners for differ-
ent types of joints. You could use a dowel
in place of a spline, for instance, in a large
miter joint. In building the bench hook, you
used dowels to fasten the face joints.
Dowels are used in fine furniture
making to join the edges of two pieces of
wood for a strong, neat joint. The steps are:
1. Drill holes, using an auger bit of the same size as the
dowels, in the edges of the two pieces.
2. Spread glue over the dowels and the edges.
3. Drive the dowels into the holes in one piece of wood.
4. Press the other piece of wood onto the dowels where their
ends are sticking out of the holes.
5. Clamp the whole assembly until the glue dries.
Dowel butt joint
A new approach to the tradi-
tional technique of the dowel
joint is called biscuit (or plate)
joinery. “Biscuits” are essen-
tially flat dowels: thin, football-
shaped pieces of compressed
beechwood that are glued
into slots much as dowels are
glued into holes. A special
machine called a biscuit (or
plate) joiner cuts a crescent-
shaped slot in each of the
pieces that are to be joined.
The slots can also be made
using a router with a biscuit-
cutter bit.


WOODWORK 61
.Project 5: Fine Woodworking
Mortise and Tenon Joint
A mortise and tenon joint has two
parts: the mortise is a hole in one piece
of wood, and the tenon is the part of
the second piece that is cut and shaped
to fit into the mortise. Simply, this joint
is “a square peg in a square hole.”
To start the mortise, drill the holes
only as deep as you want the mortise
to be. Then use a sharp wood chisel to
shave out any excess wood and square
the corners. To make the tenon, mark
its depth and width on the end of the
tenon piece. Use a backsaw to cut the
tenon, making a series of straight,
square cuts to remove excess wood.
Project Ideas
For requirement 6, you might choose a
project below, take an idea from a book
or website listed in the resources sec-
tion, or think of something on your own.
Whatever your project, make working
drawings before you begin building it.
• A picture frame with miter joints
and/or beveled edges
• A stool with rounded edges and/or
mortise and tenon joints
• Wall shelves with mortise and tenon
or dowel joints
• A small table with a round top and
dowel fastenings for legs and top
• A three-legged coffee table with a
curved top, as illustrated
1/4" = 1"
Think of “tenant”—someone who
dwells inside a place—to help you
remember that the tenon (the peg)
goes inside the mortise (the hole).

For optional requirement 6(e), your merit badge counselor or
Scoutmaster may suggest a Good Turn that you and your
buddies can do. Your school or religious institution or the
organization that operates your troop may have some wood-
working that needs doing.
If you would like to make wooden toys, discuss your ideas
with your Scoutmaster or counselor. Either of them can help
you deliver your creations to children who will love them.
You may want to donate the toys through an organization that
serves underprivileged families.
Paddle Boat
Your local library probably will have books with plans for mak-
ing wooden toys. A few such books are listed in the resources

Steps for Making the Paddle Boat
1. Cut and shape the hull as shown.
2. Shape paddle stays A and B. Using brass
screws (which do not rust), screw the paddle
stays onto the sides of the hull.
3. Drill shallow holes at a slight angle in the
superstructure to hold the funnel and mast.
Glue the funnel and mast dowels in place.
4. Glue the superstructure to the hull.
5. Make the paddle from two pieces of 3
⁄8"
plywood. Using a backsaw, cut a 3
⁄8" x 3
⁄4" slot
in each, as shown. Remove waste wood with
a small chisel. Fit and glue the pieces together.
Allow the glue to dry thoroughly.
6. Varnish or paint the boat and the paddle to
protect the wood from water.
7. Insert two brass screws in the upper ends of
the paddle stays, as shown, to hold an elastic
band. Fit the paddle in place between the
stays, held by the elastic band.
8. Wind up the paddle until
the elastic band is fully
stretched. Put the boat in
water and release. (A strong,
thick band will move the
boat quickly over a short
distance. A thinner band
produces less speed but
longer range. Experiment
to find the best size.)

Finishing Wood.
Finishing Wood
The final step in a woodworking project is finishing, that is,
removing or covering blemishes, smoothing the surface, and
protecting or coloring the wood with a treatment such as paint
or stain.
Removing or Covering
Use a wood filler to fill and cover imperfections in the wood
such as knots and small knotholes. Set nails (drive them below
the wood’s surface with a nailset) and fill the holes with wood
filler. Also fill countersunk screw heads.
Sanding
Sanding removes tool marks and smoothes wood surfaces.
Always sand with the grain of the wood. For flat surfaces use a
sanding block. If you don’t have a store-bought sanding block,
make one from a block of wood about 6" x 31
⁄2" x 1". Pad the
top and bottom with cork or felt to protect the work. Wrap the
sandpaper around the block and hold it against the sides of the
block as you work.
Sandpapers come in different
grits, or textures, from coarse to
super fine. The higher the grit num-
ber, the finer the sandpaper. Which
grit you use depends on the wood
and on the work you are doing. In
general, start sanding with a coarser
sandpaper and then finish with a
finer paper.
For most projects, you will
finish sanding with a 150- or
180-grit sandpaper. The higher
grits are mostly used for putting an
exceptionally smooth surface on
fine woodwork and furniture.

FELT PADDING

WOODWORK 65
.Finishing Wood
Use the following table as a guide for choosing the right
sandpaper for the job.
Sandpapers come in different types as well as different
grits. The two types that woodworkers use most are aluminum
oxide and garnet. Aluminum oxide is long-lasting and usually
used with power sanders. Most papers meant for hand sanding
have particles of garnet, a natural abrasive.
Protecting and Coloring
The finish you put on a project depends on the project and
on your personal tastes and preferences. Wood stain brings
out the beauty of the grain and enhances the wood’s natural
color. Paint (enamel, for example) covers and hides the wood
and can color it almost any shade imaginable. Varnish, shel-
lac, and lacquer give a hard, glossy finish while exposing the
beauty of the wood. Wax protects varnish and will polish to a
smooth, shiny finish.
If you are undecided about a finish, talk with your merit
badge counselor, the shop teacher at school, or a salesperson
at a paint store. They may suggest suitable finishes and how
to apply them. Your project might require a filler coat or sealer
before you apply the finish. For a beautifully varnished surface,
you might apply three or four coats, sanding (after the varnish
dries) with extra-fine sand-paper between coats. Ask the advice
of someone knowledgeable. Also see “Painting, Staining, and
Varnishing Wood” in the “Home Furnishings How-Tos” section
of the Home Repairs merit badge pamphlet.
Grit Common Name Uses
40–60 Coarse Heavy sanding and stripping; roughing
the surface
80–120 Medium Removing tool marks and minor
imperfections; smoothing the surface
150–180 Fine Final sanding before applying a finish
220–240 Very fine Sanding between coats of stain or sealer
280–320 Extra fine Removing dust spots or marks between
finish coats
360–600 Super fine Fine sanding of the finish to dull the luster
or remove shallow scratches
Use a good
quality brush for
staining, painting,
and varnishing,
and be sure to
clean your brush
in the proper
solvent as soon
as you are done.

.Careers for Woodworkers
Careers for
Woodworkers
If you like working with wood, you might consider doing it for
a living. Many opportunities exist. Some woodworkers work in
sawmills and plywood mills. Some make furniture and kitchen
cabinets. Some make baseball bats, racquets, oars, toys, tool
handles, and musical instruments. Some operate machines that
cut, assemble, and finish raw wood to make doors, windows,
flooring, paneling, molding, and trim for new homes.
Carpenters, of course, also work with wood. Rough car-
penters assemble the frameworks of buildings and cover the
frames with sheathing, siding, and shingles. Finish carpenters
do the interior work of hanging doors and windows, installing
paneling and trim, laying floors, building stairs, and hanging
kitchen cabinets. Some carpenters help to build bridges, docks,
industrial plants, and ships.
Training
Woodworkers and carpenters learn their trades through both
on-the-job training and classroom study. Some attend a techni-
cal or vocational school. Becoming a skilled woodworker often
takes at least two years after high school. To prepare, you should
take math, science, and computer classes in school, and also
shop and mechanical drawing.
The United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America;
Associated General Contractors Inc. (AGC); and the National
Association of Home Builders offer apprenticeship programs. In
addition, local chapters of the Associated Builders and Contractors,
as well as the AGC have training programs that combine on-the-job
training with classroom work. Check the resources section for the
addresses and websites of these organizations.


68 WOODWORK
Careers for Woodworkers.
To learn carpentry, an appren-
ticeship may be best. Apprentices
learn on duty, and they also have
classes in safety, first aid, blueprint
reading, freehand sketching, basic
math, and different carpentry tech-
niques. Usually, apprentices must be
at least 17 years old and meet local
requirements. For example, some
union locals test an applicant’s apti-
tude for carpentry. Apprenticeship
programs usually last three or
four years.
The Work
Many occupations for woodwork-
ers and carpenters are physically
demanding. You will need to be fit,
with a good sense of balance and
good eye-hand coordination. You
also will need an eye for detail,
patience, and the ability to work
from a blueprint or scale drawing
and to follow detailed instructions
and specifications.
When the economy slows and
little construction work is available,
steady work for carpenters can be
unpredictable. Carpenters who know
how to do any kind of carpentry have
the best chances for staying busy.
They may build, repair, or remodel
homes, schools, or offices, doing vari-
ous jobs from rough framing to fine
finishing work. Carpenters with all-
around skills can usually find a new
assignment when they have finished
their current one, or they can set up
shop for themselves.


WOODWORK 69
.Careers for Woodworkers
Millwork: doors,
sashes, base-
boards, trim,
mantels, or other
products made
by machine.
Highly skilled custom woodworkers and cabinetmakers
often open their own shops. They specialize in making one-of-a-
kind furniture and other items, often using traditional hand tools
and portable power tools. Production woodworkers, on the other
hand, may operate high-speed computer-controlled machines to
turn out lots of identical wooden parts. Many processes in mills
and manufacturing plants are now automated. This means that
woodworkers with computer skills are increasingly in demand.
To Learn More
Working conditions and wages vary considerably in different
parts of the United States. A local carpenter or cabinetmaker will
be able to tell you about your area. To ask about apprenticeships
or other career opportunities, contact local building contractors
or the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America.
(See the resources section.) For more information about wood-
working occupations, check with cabinetmakers, millwork firms,
furniture makers, sawmills, or lumber dealers in your area.
