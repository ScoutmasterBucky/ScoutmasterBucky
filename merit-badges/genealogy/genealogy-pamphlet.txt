Introduction.
Introduction
Exploring your roots—where your family name came from,
why your family lives where it does, what your parents and
grandparents did for fun when they were your age—can be
fascinating. Discovering your ancestors—your parents,
grandparents, great-grandparents, and so on—back through
history is what genealogy is all about.
Doing genealogical research is like being a private
investigator. Getting started is easy: You list your name, your
birthday, and the places you have lived. Then you record
the same information for your brothers and sisters and your
parents and their parents. This pamphlet will help you find and
organize the information you gather, learn new skills, and gain
a new appreciation of who you are.
The Influence of Family and Personal
History on Society
As you research your family, you will discover what life was
like for your ancestors and will feel more connected to them.
You might find out how your grandmother felt when her first
child was born or what your great-grandfather did for a living.
Daily life might not have changed as much as we may be
led to believe. As you trace your ancestors’ history, you may
learn that they lived in a different country, ate different food, or
wore different clothes, but you probably will find that the same
things that make life meaningful to you today are the things
that made life meaningful to your ancestors.
Several suggested activities for this merit badge involve
extensive online reading and research. It is strongly
advised that Scouts view the Personal Safety Awareness
videos before starting work. Find details at

Tips for Online Safety
The internet is a useful and convenient tool. But you should use
the internet only with your parent or guardian’s permission and
knowledge, and when you are online, be careful to guard your
privacy and protect yourself from potentially harmful situations.
These tips will help you stay safe. Your parent, guardian,
counselor, or librarian may talk with you about other rules.
• Follow your family’s or school’s rules for going online. Respect
any limits on how long and how often you are allowed to be
online and what sites you can visit.
• Protect your privacy. Never exchange emails or give out
personal information such as your phone number, your
address, your last name, where you go to school, or where
your parents or guardians work, without first asking your
parent or guardian’s permission. Get your parent or guardian’s
permission before sending anyone any family photographs.
• Only open emails or files you receive from people you know
and trust. If you get something suspicious, trash it just as you
would any other junk mail.
• If you receive or discover any information that makes you
uncomfortable, do not respond. Immediately tell your parent,
guardian, or another responsible adult.
• Never agree to get together with someone you meet online,
unless your parent or guardian approves and goes with you.
• Keep your internet password a secret.
• Always get your parent or guardian’s permission before doing
any online shopping.
• Remember that not everything you see or read online is reliable.
Along with lots of great information, the internet has lots of
junk. Learn to separate the useful from the worthless. Talk with
your counselor or another experienced adult web user about
ways to tell the difference.
• Be a good online citizen. Do not do anything that harms others
or is against the law.

Your Life and Your
Family History
No one knows more about you than you. The easiest place
to start your family history is with your own history. You can
begin your life story by doing some of the following activities.
Writing a Journal
You should write in your journal on a regular basis—every
day, every week, or every month. It is a log of your activities,
thoughts, and feelings. You can write about things such as:
• Family milestones, such as births, graduations, awards, deaths
• Where you live and the room in which you sleep
• What you ate for breakfast, lunch, or dinner
• Your likes and dislikes
• The people you live with
• Other relatives and friends
• What happened in
school or with your
friends
• After-school and
weekend activities
• Your future plans—
what you hope to do
or want to be
This list is just a
suggestion of some topics
you might discuss in
your journal. Write about
what is important to you.

Recording Your Life Story
A personal history, or life story, tells about what happened in
the past. It may include quotes or stories from your journal or
diary. In a small way, writing about your own and your family’s
history helps preserve the history of our nation. Start your life
story by listing the following:
• Your full name
• The date and place of your birth
• The full names of your mother and father, brothers
and sisters, and other relatives
• The addresses of any places you have lived
Then write about what you know or remember about your past
and current life. You might describe the following:
• Your earliest memories
• The different places you have lived
• Your friends and what you do together
• What your father, mother, or other relatives do (or did)
for a living
• Errands or household duties
• Any health problems you have had
• Hobbies
• Community activities
• Vacations
• Favorite sports, books, or music
• Schools you have attended
• Your favorite and least favorite subjects in school
You might also tell about happy, funny, or hard times in your
life. Be honest about your thoughts and feelings.

Anne Frank:
A Diary of Hope Amid Tragedy
One of the finest examples of a young person
recording their life story is Anne Frank. This
German-Dutch teenager
of Jewish heritage
became one of the most
discussed victims of the
Holocaust (the mass
murder of European
Jews and other groups
by the Nazi Germans
before and during
World War II) when her
diary writings were
posthumously (meaning,
after her death)
published in 1947. In The Diary of a Young Girl
(originally titled The Secret Annex) she documents
her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944, during the
German occupation of the Netherlands in World War
II. It is one of the world’s best-known books and has
been the basis for several plays and films.
In October 1942, 13-year-old Anne dreamed
of a career as a film star in Hollywood. Two years
later, her greatest wish was to publish a book about
her time in hiding. What development did Anne go
through in the secret annex?
You might want to consider her story as well
as some other well-known published journals and
diaries for examples of what you want to record.
Remember what Anne Frank once wrote about
keeping a journal: “I can shake off everything as I
write; my sorrows disappear, my courage is reborn.”

Making a Time Line
A time line is a chart that shows the events in a person’s life.
A time line can show the events from a person’s birth until the
present or from birth until death if the person has died.
You can make a time line as simple or as complex as you
like. It should include at least 10 items. If you want to make a
detailed, illustrated time line, use large paper (such as butcher
paper) so you will have plenty of space for drawing or for add-
ing photographs. If you choose not to illustrate your time line,
an 81/2-by-11-inch sheet of paper will work well.
The time line shown here has a horizontal line that
represents a person’s life. The vertical lines indicate
dates and events. The distance between the lines
shows the time span between events. For example,
if there is a span of five years between two events
on the time line, the space on the line between
those two events will be larger than the space
between two events that occurred one
year apart.
You can make a time line for
yourself or for your father, mother,
or another relative. Show the events
that were important in your life or
your relative’s life, such as birth,
births of brothers or sisters,
starting school or a sports or
music program, vacations,
or health problems. You
also can include the
dates of community
or world events
such as the year
a new president
was elected.

Gathering
Information
From Family
Members
When you interview a relative,
you begin the process of collecting
genealogical information about your
family. You can then start preparing a
family tree, or pedigree chart. When
making a family tree, try to gather
information from several sources so
you can evaluate and decide which
information is the most accurate.
Research into any subject consists
of deciding which questions you
want answered and then collecting
information until you have found the
answers. For example:
• Whom do you want to learn more about?
• What do you want to know about these individuals?
• When did certain events take place, such as births,
marriages, or deaths?
• Where did those events take place?
• How did your ancestors get from one place to another?
• Why might your ancestors have made certain choices in life?
A family history tells of the family as a unit and describes
each person. It might include quotes or stories from different
relatives. A family history should include as many generations
as possible. When gathering family information from relatives,
you will need to talk or write to them to obtain information
about their lives. You might ask about the following:
• Their full names
• What they do (or did) for a living
• The names of their parents, brothers, and sisters
Pages from a family Bible can tell you
important dates in the family’s history.


GENEALOGY 15
.Gathering Information From Family Members
• What their clothes, food, and homes were like when they
were growing up
• Where they lived and what the community was like
• Community activities they were involved in
• Military service and what it was like
• Choices they made in life such as whether or not to go to
college or to take a certain job
• Stories of things that happened to them—the funniest, the
most embarrassing, the one they learned the most from, or
the one they feel is most important to share
To get the right answers in genealogy, you must begin by
asking the right questions. Then you must know where to go to
find accurate answers. The first place to start is your home.
Do this in person or by phone, email, or letter. Longtime
neighbors may add helpful information. If your family moved
to the United States from another country, it is important to ask
your parents or guardians and other relatives about the country
where they lived. Even if you are not formally interviewing all
these people, write down or record the information they tell you.
Not all the information someone tells you is necessarily
correct. Relationships (such as great-uncle Ralph was Grandpa
Erickson’s brother) are usually correct. But names, places,
and dates may not be accurate. People tend to forget details.
Double-check the information you gather against other records.
Look for the following sources of history in your home:
• Certificates (of birth, baptism, marriage, death)
• Birth announcements
• Funeral programs, obituaries, and other newspaper clippings
• Wedding invitations and announcements
• Family Bibles
• Letters, diaries, and journals
• Military records and other personal records
• Deeds and wills
• Photographs
After locating these, visit other relatives (or call or write to them)
to find out what records they have. It can be fun to talk to them
and discover what they have and to hear what they know.

Family heirlooms can be good sources of historical information. Memorabilia such
as war medals, report cards, and newspaper clippings might give a glimpse of an

or guardian’s
permission before
using the internet
to search for
family records.
Gathering Information
From Records and
Other Sources
After you have gathered as much information as you can from
your family, it is time to start searching through records. Records
will help you make sure the information you have gathered
from your family is correct and will help you discover new
information that your family did not know.
Helpful Genealogical Records
Now for the great mystery in genealogy—which records do
you use? It is really not much of a mystery at all. Just think
about how many records about you there already are. A birth
certificate was issued when you were born. Your place of
worship may have a record of your birth or of ceremonies you
participated in. Schools you have attended have records on
you as well. These are some of the basic record types that are
often used in genealogy.
A good place to start looking for records is your local
library or genealogical society. To find out if your community
or county has a genealogical society, use an internet search
engine. If there is not such an organization near enough for you
to visit, you can always call or write to one. The staff cannot
trace your ancestors for you, but they can point you in the
right direction.
Even if your parents or ancestors were not born in the
United States or Canada, there are usually records made about
them in the country where they lived. Many of the records
are of the same type as those used in the United States. Use
a research guide for the country to find the records that will
be most helpful. Such research guides and other helps can be

found by using the internet sites www.cyndislist.com
or www.familysearch.org along with other websites
mentioned in the resources section.
Using Vital Records
Vital records are created to record births, marriages, and deaths.
By obtaining copies of these kinds of certificates, you can get
accurate information about names, dates, places, and other
details from your ancestors’ lives. These records may be created
by governments or by families.
In the United States, each state now creates the basic vital
records. This has not always been the case. In many parts
of the country, counties created these records, while in other
areas (in some New England states), towns created them.
Hundreds of years ago in Europe and colonial
America, religious institutions often
were the only groups
that kept such
records. Records
made by a place of
worship, however,
are not called
“vital records.” We
call them “church
records” or “religious
institution records.”
Such records can
be very helpful if
you are researching
ancestors who were
born or married in
another country or in this
country at a time when
government records were
not kept.
Some families keep a record of the names and birth
dates of all family members. In earlier times, many
people recorded vital events in the family Bible.


GENEALOGY 19
.Gathering Information From Records and Other Sources
Locating Various Vital Records
“Where to Write for Vital Records” tells when a state began to keep vital
records and gives the address and amount of the fee you need to pay
to get copies of certificates of birth, death, marriage, or divorce. This
pamphlet also will tell you where the records for modern time periods
are housed. They may be in state archives, vital statistics bureaus, or
state libraries. Records created by counties are usually stored in the
county courthouse. Town records are normally in the office or home of
the town clerk. You often can get copies of these records (on microfilm,
microfiche, or printed in books) in genealogical libraries.
“Where to Write for Vital Records” is available free on the internet
at www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w/. The same information is also available at
www.vitalrec.com. If you do not have access to the internet at home,
find out whether your local library has the internet available.
If your parents or ancestors came from another country, the
International Vital Records Handbook can help you find out where to
obtain birth, marriage, and death records for them (see the resources
section). This book is available at many public libraries and contains
instructions and forms for ordering vital records from more than
200 countries.

Gathering Information From Records and Other Sources.
Using Indexes to Vital Records and Other Records
Many genealogical records have indexes that make them easier
to use. An index takes all the names from a large number of
records and puts them in alphabetical order, so you do not
have to waste time looking randomly through several volumes
of records. Sometimes the index is in the record. Often it is a
separate volume. Indexes to state vital records are sometimes
available in major genealogical libraries, such as the Family
History Library in Salt Lake City, Utah. In addition, there are
many indexes to vital records on the internet.
An index is just a shortcut for finding a record. It does not
contain the full content of the record itself. You should always
try to find a copy of the original record. For example, an index
of birth records may include the person’s name and birth date
but may not include the names of the person’s parents.


GENEALOGY 21
.Gathering Information From Records and Other Sources
There is another good reason why you should always try to
find the original record. Every index has at least a few mistakes
in it. Sometimes the mistakes are small, such as the misspelling
of a name, but other times a mistake such as the one shown
below could throw you completely off the trail of your ancestors.
Some records have been destroyed by fire or other disasters.
For example, many records in the southeastern United States
were destroyed in the Civil War (1861–65). And in other cases,
the records may never have been created. Just after the war
people were too
busy trying to
rebuild and
survive to bother
with making
vital records.
When
government
records are
not available,
then family
and religious
institution records
become more
important. Good
supplements
also are found in
federal and state
censuses and
military records. 1880 U.S. Census Index, www.familysearch.org
The index showed the family’s surname as Styerman. The family’s surname was
actually St. German. By looking at the handwriting on the original record, you can
see how the person who copied the record for the index misread the name.

Using Census Records
Census records are another major type of record used in
genealogy. Census records are created to help determine the
number of representatives for government, how many people
should pay taxes, and similar information. Census records
help us piece together family histories because they often list
the people who are living together in the same house. Census
records exist for most countries.
In the United States, census records are one of our best
genealogical sources. U.S. census records began in 1790, and
in 1850 U.S. census records began to list every family member
by name.


GENEALOGY 23
.Gathering Information From Records and Other Sources
U.S. federal census records are taken every 10 years. They
are arranged by state and then usually by county within each
state. Several types of indexes often are available to help you
find the record of a specific person or family within the census
record. The internet has many of these indexes, together with
scanned images of the actual census, and some of the services
are free to use.
A wealth of genealogical information can be found
when you locate the record of your ancestor’s family in the
U.S. census. The censuses of 1880, 1900, 1910, and 1920 are
particularly rich in detail. The 1850, 1860, and 1870 census
records are helpful, but they give less information about each
person. The majority of the 1890 census was destroyed by fire.
Among the legacies of slavery is the way in which
enslaved African Americans were counted in U.S.
censuses from 1790 to 1860. They were listed only
by their first names. It was not until slavery was
outlawed that African Americans who had once been
slaves were able to choose surnames. Members of
the same family did not always take the same name,
which can make compiling an in-depth family history
extra challenging.
If you need to find census records for a country other than the United
States, check a research guide. You can learn which years censuses exist
for particular countries and how to access them.


24 GENEALOGY
Gathering Information From Records and Other Sources.
Census records do not become available until 72 years after
the census was taken. Until then, everything in the census is
private and can be obtained only by a close relative, who must
show a need to have a copy of the entry from the census record.
The latest census available as of April 2022 is the 1950 census.
To find a relative in a census record you need to know
the following:
• The name the relative was using. For a married female
ancestor this is important because she would be listed under
her maiden surname prior to marriage. After she married,
she would be listed under her married surname.
• The place where the relative was living at the time of
the census. If you are looking for a person in a U.S. census,
for example, you need to know which state and county the
person was living in at the time the census was taken. In a
county, you need to know which town your relative lived in.
In a city, you should know the person’s address or at least
which part of the city he or she lived in.
Steps for Finding Someone
on the Census
Step 1—Decide which census you want to search.
Step 2—Is it on the internet? Many U.S. censuses
available (and many for other countries) are on
the internet.
Step 3—Is it indexed? All of the available U.S.
censuses are indexed. You can access the indexes by
searching the following websites: www.familysearch.
org, www.ancestry.com, and www.genealogy.com.
Be sure you know whether the index you are using
includes every name on the census or only the heads
of households. Knowing this will affect your search
strategy.
Step 4—Is there a local library, genealogical society, or
Family History Center near you that has a subscription
to the above websites? Access to the censuses on
these websites is not free.


.Gathering Information From Records and Other Sources
If there is a good statewide index, you may not need to
know exactly where the relative lived within the county or
state. However, if you do have this information, it will help
you recognize your family if several people in the area have
the same name.
Using Newspapers
You can find information about your ancestors in newspaper
articles. You may find some in your home or in libraries or in
newspaper offices. Obituaries and birth and wedding notices are
where you will most often find family history information.
Tens of thousands of newspapers have been published
in the United States, past and present. When looking for
information about your ancestors, do not overlook
smaller newspapers that cater to a particular city
neighborhood, ethnic or racial group, or religious
group. For example, more than 5,000 African
American newspapers have been published at
one time or another, some dating back to
the early 1800s. Such newspapers might
have printed a detailed obituary of your
ancestor if he or she was well-known
in the community, whereas large-
circulation newspapers often print
only brief death notices. A librarian
can help you find newspapers that
might be useful to you and can assist
you in obtaining microfilm copies
if they are available.

Gathering Information From Records and Other Sources.
Using Cemeteries
Tombstones are a great source of information about people.
For many cemeteries, the names, dates, and other information
on tombstones have been copied, or transcribed, and the
information put into books or on the internet. A local
genealogical society or Family History Center might be able
to help you locate a transcription of a cemetery that is too far
away for you to visit.
Using Family and Local Histories
Family histories—those put together by family members—are
another source of genealogical information. Relatives may
have kept a copy of their family history in their homes, but
sometimes they are available in libraries. They may be just
lists of family members with their dates and places of birth,
marriage, and death, plus the names of relatives. Or they may
include detailed biographical information about each person.
Books about the history of towns and counties often
include biographical sketches of early settlers and
leading citizens. If your ancestors have been in
the United States for several generations, you may
find information about your ancestors in one of
these books.


GENEALOGY 27
.Gathering Information From Records and Other Sources
Using Family Organizations
An extended family organization is one that includes your
grandparents, aunts, uncles, and first cousins. It also may
include your great-grandparents, your grandaunts and
granduncles, and your second cousins. Members of your
extended family can be helpful in telling you about your family
history and genealogy.
In addition to these informal family organizations, two
types of more formal family organizations are organized with
genealogical purposes in mind: ancestral family organizations
and surname organizations.
Ancestral family organizations are created around an
ancestral couple and include all of their descendants. For
example, John and Jane Clough who came to America in the
early 1600s are the center of a Clough family organization.
Everyone who belongs to this organization should be able
to trace his or her ancestry to this couple. The purposes of a
family organization are to do good research into the ancestry
and descendants of a couple and to record and share the
information. Such an organization often publishes extensive
family genealogies and newsletters that may be available in
some major libraries.
A surname organization is based on a surname that is
associated with a specific geographical area and time period.
The geographical area may be quite small, or it may include
an entire country. For example, the Deweese Family of America
Lineage Societies
Lineage societies are organizations that require a
person to be able to trace and document his or her
ancestry to the group of people the society is honoring.
For example, the Society of California Pioneers is for
the descendants of California settlers before the gold
rush (pre-1850). The International Society of Sons and
Daughters of Slave Ancestry is a lineage society that
honors ancestors who were enslaved. Lineage societies
have both national and local chapters. Your local library
or genealogical society can help you identify and
obtain current addresses for lineage societies that may
be of interest to you.

covers the entire United States from the 1680s to the present.
Surname organizations are interested in the genealogical records
of anyone with the surname, and they use the information
they collect to try to establish various family relationships.
A surname organization often records this information and
deposits it in a library or archive where interested persons can
access the information.
Using Genealogical Periodicals
Genealogical periodicals or magazines can provide helpful
information on how and where to find sources. Information
taken from censuses and vital records (from counties, towns,
religious institutions, cemeteries, and family records) may also
be published in them. Some of these magazines are listed in
the resources section of this pamphlet. Contact your local or
state genealogical society for a list of periodicals that would be
helpful for your research.
Deciding Which Records to Use
Now that you are familiar with the types of records that are
available, you can start thinking about what information you
want to track down. Here is one example of some steps you
might take to uncover new information.
Step 1—Decide what you want to find out. For example,
“Who were my great-grandpa’s parents?”
Step 2—Find out what kind of record will give you that
information. You might recall that your birth certificate gives
the names of your parents, so maybe your great-grandpa’s birth
certificate will give the names of his parents. You also remember
that your mother told you your great-grandpa was born about
1903 in Massachusetts.
Step 3—Find out where the records you need can be found.
If you discover that records for births in Massachusetts in
1903 are available at the Family History Library, you could
rent a microfilm copy from a local Family History Center and
get a copy that way. Many can be obtained online; see the
resources section.
Many of the periodical articles have been indexed in
the Periodical Source Index, or PERSI for short. You
can search PERSI for free at www.findmypast.com.


GENEALOGY 29
.Gathering Information From Records and Other Sources
This new information enables you to start the process over
again with a new question. For example, you might now decide
to see what you could find out about your great-grandfather’s
brothers and sisters. A census record would list the whole
family together, so you might decide to look at the first census
that was taken after your great-grandfather was born. A
librarian at your local library could help you access a website
the library subscribes to that indexes census data. Suppose
you find that the census you want—the 1910 census—is not
available. That is not a problem. You go to Plan B and search

can use the library’s resources free of charge. In
addition, thousands of associated branch libraries
called Family History Centers are located throughout
the world. Family History Centers are often located
in local meetinghouses of The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints and staffed by volunteers.
Most Family History Centers have computers with
internet access to genealogy websites.
The FHL’s collection includes more than two
million rolls of microfilm and thousands of bound
books. New microfilm of genealogical records from
all over the world is continually being made.
All of the library’s holdings are described in
the FamilySearch Catalog, which is available on
the internet at www.familysearch.org. Most of the
microfilms in the FHL’s collection can be rented
through a local Family History Center. Usually the
films must be ordered, and there is a small fee to
cover the postage and other expenses.

the 1920 census, which has been indexed. Your experience
searching the census record might go something like this:
Librarian: “Just type in Edward Quinn and choose
Massachusetts as the state.”
You: “There are no matches.”
Librarian: “Are you sure he lived in Massachusetts
in 1920?”
You: “Maybe not. I think my mom said that the family
lived in Rhode Island, too.”
Librarian: “Let’s try that.”
You: “Still no matches.”
Librarian: “Do you know anything else about
Edward’s family?”
You: “I know his father’s name was Michael and his
mother’s name was Catherine.”
Librarian: “Maybe we should try searching on Michael
Quinn in Rhode Island.”
You: “There are 11 matches! One has a wife Catherine
and a teenage son named Edward!”
Librarian: “Looks like you found what you were
looking for.”
As you can see, you do not always get instant results. Some-
times you need to do a little creative thinking to come up with
another name or place that may yield the results you are looking
for. When you find a useful census record, make a copy of it.
The record can give you quite a bit of information, including the
ages and names of family members.
How to Use the Information You Gather
As you gather information on your family, you may find that
some of it includes errors and/or contradictions. Contradictions
occur when two records show different things. When you find
an error or contradiction, you have to figure out which sources
are the most trustworthy. You might need to do some detective
work in evaluating the material you have gathered.


GENEALOGY 31
.Gathering Information From Records and Other Sources
Practice your genealogy detective skills by reading the fol-
lowing story. See if you can catch the errors and contradictions.
Case Study
Your dad tells you that your grandpa—his dad—Zacharias
Smith, was born January 26, 1925, in Portland, Multnomah
County, Oregon, to parents Ebenezer Smith and Sara Woodbury.
Your dad also told you that Ebenezer was a famous lumberjack.
You go to a local library and find a history of Portland, Oregon.
Believe it or not, you find Ebenezer mentioned as a lumberjack,
but it does not say that he was particularly famous. The book
mentions Sara, but it gives her maiden name as Woodburn,
not Woodbury. You decide to get Zacharias’ birth certificate,
hoping that it will tell you his parents’ names. It does, and
there Sara’s name is listed as Sara Elizabeth Woodbury (she
was also the informant, that is, the person who informed the
clerk of the birth). The birth certificate also says that Zacharias
was born January 22, 1925. You check the 1930 census to find
out how old Ebenezer and Sara were. You find them in Portland
with Zacharias and his brothers and sisters. Ebenezer was a
35-year-old lumberjack and Sara was a 37-year-old housewife.
The census also shows that he was born in Tennessee and she
was born in Nebraska.
What was Sara’s maiden name? Two out of three of your
sources said her name was Woodbury, while only one said
Woodburn. Also, which of the three sources is most likely to
be trustworthy? Zacharias’ birth certificate is probably the most
reliable (as long as the clerk who wrote the record did not

Gathering Information From Records and Other Sources.
make a mistake) because the information about her name came
from Sara herself. Your dad’s memory is a pretty reliable source.
The least reliable source would be the Portland history. That is
because it is not a firsthand source, and you are not sure where
the author got the information.
About when were Ebenezer and Sara born? You can
estimate their years of birth because you know how old they
were at the time of the 1930 census. If you subtract Ebenezer’s
age, 35, from 1930, you get 1895. If you subtract Sara’s age,
37, from 1930, you get 1893. Ebenezer would have been born
around 1895, and Sara would have been born around 1893.
Remember, however, that these are only estimates. You still do
not have their exact birth dates.
Can you trust your father’s memory? He was right about
some of the facts he gave you. However, he did not know Sara’s
middle name, and he was off four days on his father’s birthday.
Also, you have not uncovered anything so far that proved your
great-grandpa was famous. Family stories are always a good
place to start, but they are not always completely correct. They
usually have some truth in them, but they can get changed or
exaggerated over the years, so it is always a good idea to dig a
little deeper.
When evaluating information, use the facts and data you
already have and compare them with the new evidence. Then
decide whether they fit together well with the rest of your
information. Do this continually as you look at more sources
of information to be sure the genealogical information you
gather is accurate.
Spelling
When evaluating records, do not write off a record simply
because the surname you are researching is not spelled the way
you are used to seeing it spelled. Surnames have not always
been spelled consistently. In earlier times, not everyone had
the privilege of learning to read and write. The person writing
down the name spelled it the way it sounded. In addition,
many countries do not use the Roman alphabet we use in the
United States. Russian, Indian, Chinese, Korean, and many
other names must be transliterated into the Roman alphabet.
Often a name can be transliterated in several different ways,
which means the spelling of the name will not always be the
same. The table provided shows some different spellings for a
selection of names.


GENEALOGY 33
.Gathering Information From Records and Other Sources
Nicknames are another thing to check.
You might have trouble finding an ancestor
because you know only the person’s nick-
name and not the full name, or vice versa.
The table here shows some first names and
the nicknames for them. Would you have
guessed some of them? Your ancestor’s name
might also be abbreviated to the initials of
his or her first and middle name.
Names of places are often spelled in
different ways, too. The key to finding your
ancestors is to have an open mind!
Keeping Track of Information
You should keep track of where you find your information so
that other people will be able to find it if they need to. Plus,
documenting your sources shows other people that they can
trust your work.
There are two ways to keep track of your steps. One way
is to write down your sources on your family group record or
some other place that makes sense to you. Another possibility
is to keep a research log.
There is no wrong or right way to document your sources.
The important part is to write them down somewhere so that
you or someone else can find the information again. Using a
research log will help you stay organized with record keeping.

Genealogy as a Profession
Professional genealogists do genealogical research to make their living.
Some work for businesses that specialize in genealogical research. The
genealogists do the actual research, but the company does all the
communicating with clients, reporting, handling of finances, taxes, and
other business matters. Some professional genealogists have their own
businesses. They do the research and handle the business aspects.
Anyone can call himself or herself a professional genealogist. It
is the responsibility of the person hiring a genealogist to determine if
he or she is qualified. The Board for Certification of Genealogists and
the International Commission for the Accreditation of Professional
Genealogists test professional genealogists to ensure they are qualified
to do good genealogical research in the area or areas of their specialty.
These programs test the genealogist in both knowledge of sources and
in actual research skills. These organizations can provide a list of gene-
alogists who have been certified or accredited.

Qualified genealogical researchers almost always specialize in a particu-
lar geographical area. This is because the record sources for each area
are different and records are constantly changing. It is not possible for
one single person to keep current in all geographical areas, although
knowledge of basic research procedures is the same in any locality.
If you ever decide to hire a professional genealogist, your local
genealogical society can usually provide you with a list of genealogical
researchers in your area and help you find out if he or she is accredited
by one of the above organizations.

The Pedigree Chart
To begin, you need a blank pedigree chart form to organize
the information you gather about your ancestors. When
making a pedigree chart, you start with yourself and then
include information about your parents, grandparents, great-
grandparents, and so on, for the direct line of your family.
You are a descendant of all the people listed on your
pedigree chart. You probably will not have all
the information at first, so just write in
what you do know and leave the
other spaces blank.

GENEALOGY 39
.Recording and Organizing Information
Step 1—Fill in your information. You are No. 1 on your pedigree
chart. Write your complete name, then your birth date with the
day first, then the month, and then the year. Always give four
digits for the year. Example: 14 May 1994. Then write the place
you were born. Write place names from smallest to largest like
this: Chicago, Cook, Illinois, United States. Chicago is the city,
Cook is the county, Illinois is the state, and United States is the
country. For foreign countries, use the same idea—that is, listing
the places from smallest to largest. There probably will be some
information on your pedigree chart that you will not be able to
fill in yet, such as your marriage information!
Here are some more examples of how to write place
names, going from smallest to largest. Later on you
will see why it is important to include so much detail.

Step 2—Fill in your father’s information in the No. 2 position
on the chart. If you do not know some of his information, such
as his place of birth or your parents’ marriage date, ask!
Step 3—Fill in your mother’s information in the No. 3 position
on the chart. Use her maiden name, which is the surname (last
name) she had when she was born. In genealogy, always use a
married woman’s maiden name if you know it.
Step 4—Fill in information for other ancestors. Now that you
understand how to record information on your pedigree chart,
you can find information about the names, dates, and places
for your grandparents and, if possible, great-grandparents.
Remember, it is fine to leave a blank space for any information
you do not yet have. Some blank spaces for your more distant
ancestors may never be filled in because there may be no records
or the records may not be available to you.

The Family Group Record Form
Your pedigree chart contains information about your parents,
grandparents, and other direct ancestors. But what about other
relatives such as brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, and cousins?
They, too, are an important part of your genealogy.
The form used to record information about them is called
a family group record form. One form usually lists information
for one family unit, that is, the father (husband), the mother
(wife), and all their children (listed in order of birth with the
oldest child first).
Slightly different formats are available, but they all show the
same basic information. To begin, first get a blank family group
record form. You may want to photocopy the one provided here.
Adding small photographs to your pedigree chart can make it more
interesting. You can buy charts with spaces built in for photos, or you
can design your own. Place a photo of each ancestor near his or her
space on the chart; do not worry if you don’t have a photo of each one.

blank forms can be printed for free from many websites. Just
search the web—with your parent or guardian’s permission.
You also can get blank charts and forms from a genealogical
supply store or a genealogical society.
All Families
Are Special
There are many different types of
families. For example, you may
live in a home with the father and
mother to whom you were born.
Or you may live in a home with
one parent, with two parents where
one is a stepparent, or with other
relatives. Your family may include half brothers and half sisters or
stepbrothers and stepsisters. Each of these persons is an important
member of your family.
On your pedigree chart it does not matter if the people you list as
your family are biological (bloodline), adopted, step, foster, or other
relationships. If you feel they are your family, list them on your forms.
Sometimes, however, there is a need to know the biological ancestry
of a person, often for medical purposes. For this reason, it may be a good
idea to place a note on the back of your genealogy forms that indicates
when a relationship is other than bloodline.
If you have questions about what name should be placed in any
position on your pedigree chart and family group record forms, ask
your parent or guardian and your merit badge counselor. There is no
right or wrong way to do it. It is a matter of individual choice.


The Family History Library in Salt Lake City, Utah, is the world’s largest library devoted
to genealogy. It is free to the public.

Developments

Years ago, family historians had to travel to the place where
the records they wanted were located. They had to copy down
by hand any information they wanted to keep. This meant that
people who wanted to do genealogy had to have the time and
money to travel.
By the middle of the 20th century, however, microfilm had
come into use. Microfilm is film of a paper document, such as
a newspaper, photographed at a reduced size. The words and
pictures on microfilm can be viewed with a microfilm reader,
which magnifies them to their original size or larger.
Microfilm copies of original records from various places can
be sent all over the world. People no longer have to travel so far
to view a record. The records travel to them! Records may be
viewed at a nearby genealogical library. The internet has made
accessing records even more convenient. With internet access,
it is possible to view many records on a personal computer in
your home or school.

Developments in Genealogy.
Microfilm and Microfiche
Micrographics is the branch of photography that
captures images of records at a size much smaller
than the original for storage and later use. Microfilm
and microfiche are the two formats most commonly
used in micrographics.
A microfilm camera reduces the size of the origi-
nal image to a size that can fit on the film. Microfilm
cameras may take pictures that range from a few
times smaller than the original to many hundreds
of times smaller than the original. Here is an image
of a Scout and the same image approximately 10
times smaller than the original. You could fit 10
images of the Scout into the space where you
originally only had one. You can see why microfilm
is a great way to store records—it takes up much
less space than the original records.
Advantages of microfilm include the following:
• There is less wear and tear on the original record.
• Microfilm can be duplicated into multiple copies so that
people in many different places can have access to the
record. In other words, microfilm makes wide distribution
of the record possible.
• Microfilm serves as an archival, or preservation, copy of
the record. If something were ever to happen to the original
record, the microfilm is a backup.
• Microfilm provides an exact image of the original record,
which prevents the possibility of mistakes creeping in
when a record is copied by hand.
• Microfilm takes up much less
storage space than the
original documents.
Microfiche is
another format
for reduction
photography.
Microfiche is a
clear, flexible card
usually measuring
approximately
6 inches by 4 inches
and is about the
same thickness
as microfilm. It is
possible to fit an
entire book, even
a large one, on a
single microfiche. Microfilm usually
comes in either
16 mm or
35 mm widths.


GENEALOGY 49
.Developments in Genealogy
Digital Imaging
During the late 20th century, micrographics was cutting-edge
technology for the preservation and distribution of original
records. In the 21st century, however, digital imaging is the tool
of choice.
A digital image is a picture of something, such as an original
census record, that is stored electronically. A digital camera
is used to take the picture. The camera converts images into
a digital code that can then be read by a computer. The code
associated with one image, usually called a file, must be stored
somewhere so that it can be seen, or retrieved, later when
someone needs it.
Data on the earliest computers were stored on paper cards
that had the code punched into them. Next, files were stored
on magnetic tape, then on magnetic disks (called floppy disks
because the first ones were actually flexible). Today, files are
stored on digital versatile discs (DVDs) or the hard drive (disk)
of a computer or other device. Digital cameras have their own
tiny hard disk on which image files are stored until they can be
transferred, or downloaded, to a computer and then saved on
to a longer-term storage device, such as a CD.
One advantage of keeping images in a digital format is that it is easy
and inexpensive to make copies. Another strength of the digital format
is that the quality of each copy is as good as the original. However, if
you do not have access to a computer or your computer does not have
the software to read the files, digital records are of no use to you. In
addition, computer technology changes rapidly, so data must constantly
be transferred from outdated storage formats to current ones.
Anywhere from
600 to 800
black-and-white
images can
be stored on
one CD. About
1,100 to 1,500
black-and-white
images can
be stored on
one DVD.


50 GENEALOGY
Developments in Genealogy.
Computers and Indexes
The enormous storage capacities mentioned above and the pro-
cessing capabilities of modern computers have made possible
not only digital imaging but also digital indexing and searching.
Suppose you were doing your research 50 years ago. What if
you did not find information about your ancestor in the place
where he or she lived? You would then have to search in all the
places near where your ancestor lived. At the least this would
have meant looking through many microfilms. But it also could
have meant having to send for, travel to, or hire someone to
search the records at another location. Now, many records have
been put into databases and indexed so you can enter what you
are searching for and let the computer do some of the hunting
for you.
The Internet
The internet increases the number of people who can access a
database. Instead of people having to get their own copy of a
database, many people can use the same database at once.
When you go to a website for a genealogical record
database, all you need to do is type in your search request. Your
computer sends your request over the internet to the server, or
mainframe computer where the database is stored. The server
then sends the information requested back to your computer.
Remember that
you should
always ask for
your parent or
guardian’s
permission before
surfing the web.

GENEALOGY 51
.Developments in Genealogy
Genealogical Databases on the Internet
Once you have decided which ancestor you are going to
research, try one or more of the following internet databases:
1. User-contributed (meaning the information is from
individual people)
2. Index of an original source
3. Images of an original source (sometimes with an index)
The difference between the three is the source of the information.
Remember that before you accept information as fact, you must
decide whether it is correct and whether it is about your ancestor.
Take a moment to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each
type of database. Understanding the limitations of a database
helps you determine the reliability of the information it offers.
User-contributed databases allow you to take advantage
of the genealogy that other people have already traced. You
might be able to get in touch with distant relatives who also
are working on your genealogy. The drawback is that the
person may not have done his or her research very carefully
and it may contain mistakes.
The database located at www.familysearch.org is an example of a large database that
comes from two sources: user contributions and indexes of original records.

52 GENEALOGY
Developments in Genealogy.
Indexes of an original record provide you with an easy-
to-search index of records from a documented source. These
indexes are based on original records and not someone’s opinion.
However, the fact that a person had to enter the information into
a computer in the first place also means that typos and other
mistakes are likely. Often you will have to pay a fee to use
these databases.
Images of an original record may or may not be indexed.
If they are indexed, they offer one of the easiest ways to access
information about an ancestor. You can look for your ancestor
and then immediately view the original source to make sure
the information is correct. If the images are not indexed on the
computer (they may be indexed somewhere else), you can still
look at the original record instead of having to find a copy of it.
Many times these databases cost money to use.
Other Genealogical Resources on the Internet
In addition to internet databases, there are many other types
of websites that can help you with your family history. For
instance, sites devoted to different countries and regions can
help you learn about the history, traditions, or customs of a
particular place. Many people working on their family histories
have put up websites where they post information about the
genealogical work they have completed so far. These sites can
be quite helpful if you find one that has information about an
ancestor you and the other person have in common. There also
are websites of archives and libraries that give information
about original records. Some of these websites are free, while
others require that you pay a fee to use them.
Local family history and historical societies can be excellent
sources of valuable genealogical information. Most societies
have websites that provide at the least a mailing address where
you can write for information. Some have sites that offer
complete online indexes of records. Many of these societies
Before April 1999, the International Genealogical Index
was available only at about 4,000 Family History
Centers and a few libraries that had copies of it. When
it was placed on the internet, it became available to
millions of people. The IGI is just one example of many
online genealogical databases.

have indexes and records that you can purchase if you cannot
find the records elsewhere.
Large archives and libraries almost always have websites.
Sometimes they have online indexes. Usually, these websites
will give you at least an idea, if not an actual catalog, of the
records the archive or library holds. They will also tell you
how you can access their records. You may be able to visit and
view their records in person, or they may have a search service
that will do the search for you for a fee. They might provide
information about professional researchers you can hire.
Menu sites, such as www.cyndislist.com, help you find
other websites. They are usually organized by place and then
subject. For instance, if you were looking for a local
genealogical society that covered Washtenaw County in
Michigan you would:
• Go to www.cyndislist.com.
• Click on Categories, scroll down to United States,
then click on Michigan.
• Click Counties and then click Washtenaw.
• In the list that appears, click on Societies & Groups.
A list of links to websites about Washtenaw County would
appear. Among these websites you would see a link for the
Genealogical Society of Washtenaw County. You can follow
these steps for any state and county in the United States, or
for other countries.
Menu sites are helpful for identifying websites that
can assist you in tracing ancestors belonging to a particular
ethnic group or nationality. If you were looking for resources
related to Jewish genealogy, for example, you could go to
www.cyndislist.com, click on Category, and then scroll down
the list of places and topics until you get to the heading
“Jewish.” Click on that heading and then select the topic that
interests you from the index listing; you will find links to many

Search engines are a great way to search the internet. Bear in
mind, however, that they are much more helpful if you are looking
for places or things rather than individual ancestors. For example,
if you were looking for the National Genealogical Society’s website,
you would type National Genealogical Society into the search
engine. Their site should be among the first few hits.
Genealogy Software Programs
Personal computers are a great help when organizing your genea-
logical research. You can type your information into a genealogy
software program instead of filling out forms by hand. Then you
can print out any charts or forms you might need. The best part
is that if you make a mistake, it is easy to correct. Another nice
Using Search Engines
Search engines typically use keywords. Keywords are words that are
unique to what you are searching for. For example, take a look at the
following sentence, “I am looking for the grave of my ancestor Rose
Goldman.” You would likely pick the words grave and Rose Goldman
because the other words are very common and can be used in many
other contexts.
If you just typed in grave and Rose Goldman, you would get thou-
sands of hits. You would need to narrow your search. To do this, you
might add the name of the place Rose Goldman died or the year of her
death to your search terms. Remember, however, that not all the Rose
Goldmans you find will be your ancestor. In fact, it is possible that none
of the matches you get will be your ancestor.
Remember, too, that computers are not as smart as you are. For
instance, suppose you are looking for your ancestor named Marco
Angelo Benedetto. You type his name into the search engine, and it does
not find him. However, if you were looking at the original record, you
would find him as M.A. Benedetto. You would know this is probably him,
but the computer was looking for an exact match. This same idea applies
to any type of search on a computer, not just a keyword search.

thing about genealogy computer programs is that you can easily
make copies of your work for other people.
These programs can do a variety of things. Not only can
you enter names, dates, and places, but you can keep track of
your information sources. If you have photos of your family,
you can scan them and position them next to the information
for that person. Some programs allow you to keep research logs
as well. Some basic programs are free, while others must be
purchased. See the resources section for information about a
few of these programs.
Genealogy Apps for Phones and Tablets
The world of genealogy has benefited from the invention of
smartphones and tablets.
Today’s phones consist of many powerful tools rolled
into one small device—a still camera, a video camera, a voice
recorder, interactive maps, language translators, and a pocket
document scanner.
There are many genealogy apps available for your device.
These allow you to access and download billions of records
from around the world as well as easily organize your family
tree in colorful formats. Some apps are free; others require a
paid subscription. Paid services frequently include access to
unique databases of historical records not available elsewhere.
Additionally, you can find some powerful genealogy
apps that are well suited to particular countries, regions, and
cultures. Those would include access to local historical records
and a community of local experts proficient in that territory.
A key feature of many genealogy apps is the ability to
collect and share important family “memories” such as photos,
historical documents, stories, and audio clips.
Scouts should consult with their parent, guardian, merit
badge counselor, or local family history center for guidance
to determine which apps, if any, would be best for their
circumstance.
Founded in 1903, the National Genealogical Society serves as a center
for genealogical activities and interest at the national level. Members of
the society are both amateur family history researchers and professional
genealogists. The NGS publishes NGS Quarterly, featuring genealogical
writing, previously unpublished source materials, and reviews of new
books in the field of genealogy. NGS Monthly features information
about the society’s activities and programs.

Developments in Genealogy.
DNA and Ancestry Research
Another area of new advances is that of genetic genealogy and
the field of DNA biosciences. A simple DNA test can reveal
much about your family tree such as ethnic makeup, unique
genetic traits, and family medical risks. DNA testing has proven
valuable in finding lost family members. As of 2019, about 30
million people had been tested.
Some genealogy DNA testing companies can find relative
matches back through 15 generations of family connections,
including paid services such as AncestryDNA and 23andMe.com.
Genealogy as a Crime-Fighting Tool
Some of today’s genealogists are active crime fighters.
Investigative genetic genealogy, also called forensic genealogy,
uses genetic information to identify suspects or victims in
criminal cases. By September 2021, the use of this practice had
led to the discovery of over 150 suspects of murder and violent
assault. This field uses publicly accessible genealogy databases.
A key element of this forensic genealogical research is to
identify shared ancestors. Data available in GEDMatch, which
is composed of genetic profiles from approximately 1.2 million
individuals, has proven capable of identifying a third cousin or
closer in over 90% of the population. This information, used in
tandem with demographic identifiers like age, gender, and place
of residence, can positively identify a criminal suspect or victim.
Law enforcement agencies use public databases to upload
crime-scene genetic data and then find people who are related
to potential suspects. Genealogy experts then create a family
tree and look for other identifiers to zero in on a single person.
Record Indexing
Indexing is a crowdsourcing volunteer effort that adds millions
of new names and historical records into searchable online
databases. Many old records are handwritten or hard to read.
Humans are much better than machines at interpreting those
old records. Through crowdsourcing, volunteers use their home
computers to compare images of the old records with the typed
index in the online database and make any corrections. This
ensures that the information in the searchable index is accurate.
Today there is a huge need for help and young people your
age around the world are leading the response to this challenge.

.Developments in Genealogy
There are many programs and tutorials to teach volunteers
and to minimize mistakes. A number of beginner tutorial videos
with screen-sharing demos can be easily found on YouTube.
The biggest leader in this field is FamilySearch.org, which
started the first large crowdsource indexing project in 2006 by
successfully transcribing the 1880 United States Census. Youth
as young as age 13 can participate.
There are usually hundreds of active indexing projects
available for anyone to join. The next great project in the
United States opened in April 2022, when the 1950 U.S. Census
was released to the public.
Another popular branch of genealogical record indexing is
the vast effort to photograph and document gravestones around
the world. A number of Eagle Scout candidates have included
this type of work as an important part of their required service
project when seeking to restore a historic site such as a
battlefield or cemetery. Two major organizations in this field
are FindAGrave.com and BillionGraves.com. An important
element here is to record the GPS coordinates for each grave,
an important skill you might have already learned about when
working on the Geocaching merit badge.
Some genealogists contact users of both BillionGraves.com
and FindAGrave.com for crowdsourcing a larger team to search
for a hard-to-find ancestor’s gravestone.
Join a Crowdsource Indexing Project
There are many projects open to volunteers age 13 and above. Each
project includes an easy tutorial on how to get started, and YouTube has
many easy-to-follow videos on youth projects for name indexing. Your
merit badge counselor could also help you get started on a project that
he/she is involved with Some volunteer opportunities include:
• A genealogy museum or family history center near you might need
help on special local historical projects.
