Aviation Merit Badge
Drone Program
Aviation Merit Badge: Requirement 2 (c)
Requirement: Build (or obtain) and fly a fuel-driven or battery-powered electric
model aircraft or drone. Describe safety rules for building and flying remote
aircraft. Describe safety rules for fuel and/or battery packs.
• Drone(s). We recommend using the DJI Tello drone which was relatively
inexpensive (~$100) and extremely easy to set up and use. Ideally, each scout
would pay a program fee so that you can provide each scout their own drone – but
if not, easily shared. (https://www.ryzerobotics.com/tello)


Drone Safety Rules:
• Building/Flying: All Scouts must complete the FAA-approved TRUST drone
safety course: (https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_flyers/knowledge_test_updates).
• Battery Packs: Review these materials with the Scouts:

• Charging station. The batteries only last for ~15 minutes of flight time, and
while 3 batteries are provided, they seem to drain quickly! Recommended setup:

• Obstacle course. It’s actually quite easy to make your own from tables, chairs,
hula-hoops, etc.
• Helipads. These are completely optional, but very fun – especially if you set
up an obstacle course race: https://tinyurl.com/hrx96nx8
• Mobile device(s). The drones connect to, and are controlled by, the mobile
device. You may have to tweak the phone’s cellular settings, based on the
phone/service provider. The drone connects to the hone via its own Wi-Fi (not
Bluetooth)
Activity:
Drone Set-Up
• Make sure the battery packs are fully charged!
• Mark each drone with the Scout’s last name, so they do not get mixed up. I
used an Avery label-maker.
• One at a time (so Wi-Fi names do not get mixed up), connect the phones to
the drone. Download the Tello app and follow the instructions. Once
connected, rename the Wi-Fi to the Scout’s name to avoid confusion.
• Have one counselor teach the basic instructions for flying the drone, while the
second counselor begins connecting the next Scout to their drone.


Individual Flights:
• Allow each Scout to fly their drone for 15-30 minutes; they may need to
change battery packs.
• Identify safety concerns. Start indoors (if possible); then, when the Scout has
sufficient proficiency, allow them to fly the drone outside in a clear field. Avoid trees!
• Once they are comfortable with the drone operation (will vary by Scout), then
show them how to take/record photos and videos on their phone. Be safety
aware along with guidelines of flying drones in your area.
Racing
• Once all Scouts are proficient with flying their drones, and recording photos/
videos, they are ready to race!
• Place two helipads on one end of the room (or field, if you need to do this
outdoors). Create two duplicate obstacle courses. Pair up Scouts according
to their abilities and have them race!
• For the first round of races, allow the Scouts to “follow” their drones – and
recover them as needed. For future races, make it more challenging by
requiring them to operate the drone by looking at their phone ONLY – i.e., they
cannot physically se the drone, only watching the video from the drone’s
perspective. Then, if they “crash”, it’s game over for them!
Follow Up
• Ask the Scouts for feedback – what did they think? What was easy for them,
most difficult? What could have been better with the activity?
• Share some of the opportunities for careers in piloting drones – real estate,
surveillance, geographic surveying, etc.
• Encourage them to fly their drones at camp, take photos/videos and share
them with the Camp Director!
