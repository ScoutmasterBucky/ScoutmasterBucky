FIRST AID 7
.Introduction
Introduction
First aid—caring for injured or ill persons until they can receive
professional medical care—is an important skill for every Scout.
With some knowledge of first aid, you can provide immediate
care and help to someone who is hurt or who becomes ill. First
aid can help prevent infection and serious loss of blood. It
could even save a limb or a life.
First-aid requirements for the Tenderfoot, Second Class,
and First Class ranks encourage you to practice treating certain
injuries and ailments. Earning the First Aid merit badge will
help you understand that emergency medical treatment is a
set of clear action steps. By following the steps every time
you come upon a first-aid emergency, you can quickly evaluate
the situation, come up with a first-aid plan, and then see that
plan through.
The Goals of First Aid
• Protect a person who is injured or ill from
further harm.
• Manage life-threatening medical emergencies until
professional help arrives. (Keep the airway open.
Maintain breathing and circulation. Stop serious
bleeding. Treat for shock.)
• Get professional medical care, if needed, for
the person.
• Provide appropriate care for minor injuries
and illnesses.
To learn how to
treat for shock,
see “How to
Handle an
Emergency.”

FIRST AID 9
.Introduction
Reducing Risk
The best treatment is prevention. One way to stay healthy and safe
both at home and when you are in the out-of-doors is to recognize
that there is an element of risk in many activities. By being aware
of risk and adjusting your behavior to manage it, you will also be
in a stronger position to provide assistance should an emergency
arise. Among the ways you can increase your role in risk manage-
ment during Scouting adventures are the following:
• Stay in good physical condition so that you are ready for the
demands of the activities you enjoy.
• Know where you are going and what to expect.
• Consider the age and skill level of the participants.
• Adjust clothing layers to match changing conditions.
• Drink plenty of water.
• Protect yourself from exposure to the sun, biting insects,
and poisonous plants.
• Take care of your gear.
Scout troops and patrols can also manage risk as a group:
• Review and practice first-aid skills and techniques on a
regular basis.
• Take responsibility for having a safe experience.
• Be sure everyone understands and follows group
guidelines established to minimize risk.
• Ensure everyone has a say in recognizing and dealing
with risks that might arise.
After you learn the first-aid skills and techniques required for the First Aid
merit badge, you can teach another Scout what you have learned. Teaching
a fellow Scout a simple first-aid skill is a great way to practice and gain
mastery of the skill and will also allow you to complete requirement 14.
First Class

(procedures) in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

.How to Handle an Emergency
How to Handle an
Emergency
Even the best plans can fall apart. Accidents will happen. People
will become sick. Most of the time first aid is relatively simple
because you are dealing with a single injury or illness. You must,
however, be prepared to handle more complex situations. You
might be the first to arrive or the most qualified, thus the person
who is most able to take charge. Here is how you should proceed.
1. Check the Scene
The site of an accident can be confusing, especially when seri-
ous injuries have occurred or there is more than one person
involved. There are a number of things to consider. The hazard
that caused the accident may still pose a threat. Seeing blood,
broken bones, vomit, or people in pain might disturb bystanders
and those trying to provide first aid (first aiders).
Before you take any action, stop for a moment to look
over the entire scene and collect your thoughts. Consider the
following questions:
• What caused the accident?
• Are there dangers in the area?
• How many victims are there and how badly are they injured?
• If there are other people nearby, can they assist with first aid
or with getting help?
• Will bystanders need guidance so that they do not become
injured or ill themselves?
Do Your Best
Good Samaritan laws protect anyone making a good-faith effort to help the
victim of an injury or illness. Whenever you are confronted with a first-aid
emergency, use your skills to the best of your ability and training. No one
expects you to have the knowledge of a physician. However, Scouting’s
history is filled with stories of Scouts who used their training to help others,
sometimes even saving lives.


12 FIRST AID
How to Handle an Emergency.
2. Do This First: Call for Help
Being prepared means knowing, in advance, how to obtain
emergency help if it is needed. Should you encounter a situa-
tion where someone has more than a minor illness or injury,
act quickly to get emergency medical help. You can reach emer-
gency services in much of the United States by calling 911.
Some communities use other emergency-alert systems such as
dialing 0 or calling a local sheriff’s office or fire department.
Instruct a bystander or another first aider to call for help imme-
diately: “You, call for help right now. Tell them where we are
and what has happened, then report back to me.”
A wilderness camping trip can take you far from telephones.
An injured Scout who can walk on his or her own or with some
support may be able to hike to a road. A group of Scouts may be
able to build a stretcher and carry a victim. For serious injuries,
though, it is usually best to treat the victim at the accident site—
provided that doing so would not further endanger the victim or
the first aiders—and send two or more people for help.
Mobile phones
are unreliable in
wilderness areas.
If you take a
mobile phone on
an outing, have a
backup plan
(perhaps a
satellite phone or
locator beacon)
for summoning
emergency
assistance.


FIRST AID 13
.How to Handle an Emergency
Write a note containing the following information and send
it with the messengers:
• Location of the victim
• Description of the injuries or illness
• Time the injuries or illness occurred
• Treatment the victim has received
• Number of people with the victim and their general skill
level for first aid
• Requests for special assistance or equipment, including food,
shelter, or care for nonvictims
Activities on open water sometimes take people far from
any help. Larger boats often have radio equipment that can be
used to summon aid. When phones or radios are not available,
however, passengers will need to make and carry out a plan for
getting help. Such a plan might involve sending two people to
the closest telephone to call for help.
3. Approach Safely
After assessing the situation and summoning help, determine
the best way to reach the injured person or persons. Perhaps an
accident victim is lying on a busy highway or has fallen and
tumbled partway down a mountainside. Will you also be in dan-
ger if you dash onto the highway or rush down the slope? Figure
out a safe way to approach the victim or to remove the dangers
from an area. Do not become an accident victim yourself.
See “First-Aid
Supplies and
Skills” for
information on
how to build
an improvised
stretcher.
In Case of Emergency
Many people carry mobile phones these days, but not
everyone carries details of whom should be called on
their behalf in case they are involved in a serious
accident. If you add the acronym ICE—for “In Case
of Emergency”—as a contact in your mobile phone,
emergency workers can quickly find someone to notify
about your condition. Ask your parent whom to list as
your ICE contact.


14 FIRST AID
How to Handle an Emergency.
Once you have figured out the safest way to approach,
introduce yourself to injured persons and to bystanders. Assure
them that medical professionals have been called and are on
the way. Speaking in a calm voice, explain that you are a Scout
trained in first aid and that you are there to help. Ask victims if
they will allow you to assist them. If the victim is unconscious,
you have “implied” consent to help them. If people are with an
unconscious victim, be sure to tell them what you plan to do. If
the victim is under 18, always get permission from a parent,
guardian, or adult, if one is present. Continue to speak to
injured or ill persons as you administer first aid, keeping them
informed of what you are doing. A person may appear to be
unconscious but may still be able to hear you.
See “First-Aid
Supplies and
Skills” for
precautions to
be taken
when moving
accident victims.
Triage
Emergency situations involving more than one victim
can require triage (pronounced tree-ahge)—quickly
checking each victim for injuries or symptoms of illness
and then determining who should get treated first and
how best to use available first-aid resources. In its sim-
plest form, triage occurs whenever first aiders approach
an emergency scene that involves two or more persons
who are injured or ill. Both first aiders and medical pro-
fessionals will determine who requires urgent care,
who can be treated later, who will be monitored in case
his or her condition changes, and who is well enough
to help out caring for others.


FIRST AID 15
.How to Handle an Emergency
Sometimes a victim’s location threatens his or her safety
and that of first aiders. For example, suppose you are out hiking
and a buddy falls into a stream or gets hurt while on an unsta-
ble boulder field or avalanche slope. It might be necessary to
move the victim to a safer location before first-aid treatment
can begin. To do this, get the help of others in your group and
lift the victim in the same position as found. Once carried to
safety, the victim should be laid down gently. (See “Moving an
Ill or Injured Person” later in this pamphlet.) Take special care
to prevent the victim’s neck from moving by supporting the
head before, during, and after the emergency move.
Remember: Do not move the victim unless you absolutely
have to for safety reasons.
4. Provide Urgent Treatment
Breathing and bleeding—these are your immediate concerns
when treating the victim of an accident or illness. Victims who
have stopped breathing or who are bleeding severely are called
hurry cases because their lives are in immediate danger. They
require smart, timely action on the part of a first aider.
Whenever you come upon an injured person, take no more
than 15 to 20 seconds to do a quick A-B-C diagnostic survey of
his or her condition to find out the following:
A Is the airway open? If they can speak the airway is not com-
pletely obstructed
B Is the person breathing? Assess breathing by placing your
ear and cheek near the victim’s mouth and nose where you
can hear and feel the movement of air. If you moisten your
own cheek it is easier to feel the movement of air. Watch for
the chest to rise and fall. Ask the person to speak. If they
cannot speak or if they appear unconscious, stabilize the
head and neck if you suspect spine injuries and perform
Protect Yourself
It is impossible to know for sure if the victim has any
diseases. You should consider all body fluids to be
infectious. Wear nonlatex gloves and, if you might be
splashed by blood, vomit, or other body fluids, also
wear a protective mask and eye shield. Your sunglasses,
rain gear, and bandana or neckerchief (over your mouth
and nose) would work if nothing else is available. (See
“Protection From Bloodborne Pathogens.”)
If the person is
breathing, the
breaths should
not be irregular
or shallow or
short; the person
should not be
gasping for air.


16 FIRST AID
How to Handle an Emergency.
compressions only CPR if the person is not breathing.
Reassess breathing the same way you did earlier.
C Circulation: Is there severe bleeding? Open rain gear and
outer clothing that might hide wounds from view. Quickly
look and feel under the body and legs for bleeding. It is very
important to inspect the entire back for bleeding. This can be
difficult, but it might be lifesaving. More than once, bleeding
from the back—or the side that is down—has been missed.
Don’t fall into this trap. Check the pulse and begin CPR if no
pulse is detected.
Are there other contributing factors? Look for a medical ID
bracelet, necklace, or card that might give information about
allergies, diabetes, or other possible causes of an emergency
situation. Persons who have asthma or allergies to insect
stings or certain foods (such as peanuts) might carry treat-
ment for their condition, such as an epinephrine injector or
rescue inhaler.
See “Life-Threatening Emergencies” for more details.
5. Protect From Further Injury
An important part of first aid is protecting an accident victim
from further injury. Follow these guidelines.
• Avoid moving an injured person unless his or her body posi-
tion makes it impossible to perform urgent first aid or he or
she is in a dangerous location. If a person’s position must be
adjusted, for example, to allow them to breathe, do so slowly
and with the minimum amount of movement.
While awaiting emergency personnel, support the victim’s head in the position you
found it, in line with the person’s body.


FIRST AID 17
.How to Handle an Emergency
• If the victim is unconscious or complains of neck pain, stabi-
lize the victim’s head and neck to prevent any neck bones
that might be broken from damaging the spinal cord. Ask a
fellow first aider or a bystander to hold the victim’s head and
neck steady to keep the neck in proper alignment.
6. Treat Every Accident Victim for Shock
The circulatory system of a person who is injured or under
great stress might not provide enough blood and oxygen to the
tissues of the body. This condition is called shock, and it can be
deadly (as organs can begin to fail). A shock victim can have
some, all, or none of the following symptoms:
• Restlessness or irritability
• A feeling of
weakness
• Lightheadedness
• Confusion, fear,
dizziness
• Skin that is moist,
clammy, cool, and
pale
• A quick, weak
pulse
• Shallow, rapid, and
irregular breathing
• Nausea and
vomiting
• Extreme thirst
Serious injuries and sudden illnesses are almost always
accompanied by some degree of shock, but the victim might
not be affected right away. Treat every accident victim for shock
even if no symptoms appear. Prompt first aid may prevent
shock from setting in.
Fear and uncertainty can increase shock. In a calm voice,
assure the person that everything possible is being done and
that help is on the way. A person who appears to be uncon-
scious may still be able to hear you. Never leave an accident
victim alone unless you must briefly go to call for help.


18 FIRST AID
How to Handle an Emergency.
7. Make a Thorough Examination
By the time you have dealt with urgent conditions and provided
treatment for shock, medical professionals are likely to have
arrived. When their arrival is delayed or the location will
require greater travel time, conduct a more thorough examina-
tion to be sure you have found all the victim’s injuries that
require attention. If the victim is alert, ask where it hurts and
whether the victim can move the arms and legs.
First Aid for Shock
1. Try to eliminate the causes of shock by restoring breathing and circula-
tion, controlling bleeding, relieving severe pain, and treating wounds.
2. Call or send someone for help.
3. Monitor the victim closely to make sure the airway stays open
for breathing.
4. If the victim is not already doing so, help the injured person lie down. If
you do not suspect back, neck, or head injuries, or fractures in the hip
or leg, raise the feet about 12 inches to move blood from the legs to the
vital organs.
5. Keep the victim warm with blankets, coats, or sleeping bags.
Look for DOTS
As you make this secondary examination of the victim
from head to toe, check for:
D = Deformity
O = Open wounds
T = Tenderness
S = Swelling
Look beneath
jackets and other
clothing that could
obscure or hide
wounds that are
bleeding. Be sure
to check the back.


FIRST AID 19
.How to Handle an Emergency
8. Plan a Course of Action
Keep a timed written record of events, observations, treatments
and how the victim responded.
After conducting the examination, determine what to do
next. The best course of action in most cases is to make the vic-
tim comfortable and continue to wait for medical help to arrive.
Maintain treatment for shock, keep the airway open, monitor
the victim for any changes, and be ready to provide any other
treatment the victim might require.
In the backcountry it may be wise to set up camp and to
shelter the victim with a tent. Rather than lifting a badly
injured person into a tent, you can slit the floor of a standing
tent and then place the tent over the person.
Be aware of your own needs, too, and those of others
around you. Stay warm and dry. If a first-aid emergency lasts
very long, be sure to eat and drink enough. Be aware that other
group members may be frightened or disoriented by what they
have seen. Be sure they do not wander off. Giving people
specific responsibilities—fixing a meal or making camp, for
example—can focus their attention and help keep them calm.
Learn all the first aid you can and review it often. Perhaps one day you will be able
to do just the right thing at a time when your actions make all the difference.

First-Aid Supplies
and Skills
You cannot render first aid if you do not have the tools and
supplies necessary to treat an injured or ill person. A well-
stocked first-aid kit is an essential item for all first aiders.
Equally important is learning and practicing difficult first-aid
skills such as how to safely transport an ill person or an
accident victim.
Personal First-Aid Kit
Carrying a few first-aid items on hikes and campouts will allow
you to treat scratches, blisters, and other minor injuries and to
provide initial care for more serious emergencies. You should be
able to fit everything in a resealable plastic bag. Always take
your personal first-aid kit when you set out on a Scout adven-
ture. Your kit should include as a minimum the following:
❑ Adhesive bandages (6)
❑ Sterile gauze pads, 3-by-3-inch (2)
❑ Adhesive tape (1 small roll)
❑ Moleskin, 3-by-6-inch (1)
❑ Soap (1 small bar) or alcohol-based
hand sanitizing gel (1 travel size bottle)
❑ Triple antibiotic ointment (1 small tube)
❑ Scissors (1 pair)
❑ Small tweezers with tick removal slot
❑ Nonlatex disposable gloves (1 pair)
❑ CPR breathing barrier (1)
❑ Pencil and paper
You may want to
add a Structural
Aluminum
Malleable (SAM®)
splint to your first-
aid kit when you
go hiking. This
device is useful
for immobilizing
injured limbs.


22 FIRST AID
First-Aid Supplies and Skills.
Home or Patrol/Troop First-Aid Kit
A more comprehensive first-aid kit suitable for home use or use
by your patrol or troop can treat a wide range of injuries. After
assembling your home kit, be sure everyone in your family
knows where the kit is being stored. It also is a good idea to
carry a first-aid kit in the car in case of roadside emergencies.
On Scout outings, the patrol or troop first-aid kit can be carried
in a fanny pack that is marked so that it will be easy for anyone
to locate. At a minimum, the kit should contain the following:
❑ Roller bandage, 2-inch (1)
❑ Roller bandage, 1-inch (2)
❑ Adhesive tape, 1-inch (1 roll)
❑ Alcohol swabs (24)
❑ Assorted adhesive bandages (1 box)
❑ Elastic bandages, 3-inch-wide (2)
❑ Sterile gauze pads, 3-by-3-inch (12)
❑ Tourniquet
❑ Moleskin, 3-by-6-inch (4)
❑ Gel pads for blisters and burns (2 packets)
❑ Triple antibiotic ointment (1 tube)
❑ Triangular bandages (4)
❑ Structural aluminum malleable (SAM®) splint
❑ Soap ( 1 small bar) or alcohol-based hand sanitizing gel
(1 travel size bottle)
❑ Heavy-duty scissors (1 pair)

Moving an Ill or Injured Person
The decision to move an accident victim should be made care-
fully. In many cases, there will be emergency medical crews,
fire department personnel, or others with special equipment
and training who will transport an injured person. If, however,
someone is in danger from fire, smoke, water, electrical haz-
ards, poisonous gases, exposure, or other immediate danger,
you must move that person to safety. You might also need to
move an injured person in order to give that person proper
care, or reach another victim. Move the person only as far as
is necessary, and do not endanger yourself.
Sometimes you will find that a victim’s injuries are minor
enough that the person can move with some assistance. Before
attempting to move someone, make sure the person is not
suffering from any of the following conditions. Then determine
the best technique to use for moving the victim or whether the
victim should not be moved at all.
• Shock
• Heart attack
• Head, neck, or back (spinal) injury
• Frostbitten or burned feet
• Bone or joint injury at the hips or below
Sometimes getting care as quickly as possible is very
important. When time is critical, you might need to decide
between moving the person to a place where they can get care
or waiting for help to come to you. Knowing which action you
take is part of your pre-event planning.
For a victim of a venomous bite or sting, getting the victim
to medical attention is the most important goal. This might call
for moving the victim before the swelling becomes too severe. If
the bite is on an arm or leg, try to minimize movement of this
extremity as much as possible.
Here are some additional assists and hand carries to con-
sider. Some can be performed by a single rescuer, while others
require two or more rescuers. Practice single- and multiple-
rescuer assists first with an uninjured person. This will help
you work smoothly and safely during a real emergency.


24 FIRST AID
First-Aid Supplies and Skills.
Single-Rescuer Assists
When an injured person must be moved, choose the method
carefully to avoid making the injuries worse and to avoid
injuring yourself. Recommended assists for a single
rescuer include the following.
Walking assist. If the victim is conscious, has
only minor injuries, and can move, you can
safely help the person walk. Put one of the
victim’s arms around your neck. Hold that
hand. Place your other arm around the
person’s waist. Ideally the victim and the
rescuer would be about the same height.
Ankle drag. The fastest method for a
short distance on a smooth surface, or to
move someone who is too large or
heavy to transport in any other
way, is to drag the person
by both ankles.
Shoulder drag.
For short distances over a rougher surface, and to
move a conscious or unconscious person who
may have head, neck, or back injuries, use the
clothes drag. Firmly grab the person’s
clothing behind the shoulder and
neck area and pull headfirst. Cradle
their head in your arms.
Blanket drag. Roll the person onto a blanket, coat, tarp, or
tablecloth, cover the person as shown, if possible, and drag
from behind the head.


FIRST AID 25
One-person lift. You may be able to carry a
child or someone who does not weigh much
if you place one arm under the victim’s
knees and one around the upper back.
Do not use this method if you suspect
spinal injury.
Firefighter carry. To travel longer
distances, carry the victim over your
shoulder if injuries will allow it.
The firefighter carry should
never be used if you suspect
the victim has a spinal injury.
Pack-strap carry. The pack-strap carry is better for longer
distances than the one-person lift and when the firefighter
carry is not practical. Use this method only if you do not
suspect spinal injury.


26 FIRST AID
First-Aid Supplies and Skills.
Multiple-Rescuer Assists
Recommended assists for two or more rescuers
include the following.
Helping the person walk. If the victim is conscious
and shows no signals of the conditions or injuries
listed earlier, two rescuers can safely help the person
walk. Put one of the victim’s arms around each
rescuer’s neck. Hold the hands. Rescuers place their
free arms around the victim’s waist.
Four-handed seat. When no
equipment is available, the
four-handed seat is the easiest
two-rescuer carry. It is safe
only if the victim is conscious
and can hold on. Position the
hands as shown.
Two-handed seat. Use this method if the victim is
conscious but not seriously injured. Rescuers place
arms on each other’s shoulder and lock arms for
stability as the victim gets into position, then move
arms from shoulders to across the victim’s back.


FIRST AID 27
.First-Aid Supplies and Skills
Chair carry. This is a good
method for carrying an injured
person up stairs or through
narrow, winding spaces.
Hammock carry. Three
to six rescuers stand
on either side of the
victim and link hands
beneath the person.
Rescue From a Smoke-Filled Room
A smoke-filled room is an extremely hazardous environment. Rushing
into a smoke-filled room or other dangerous scene to help someone will
do no good if you also become a victim. If your safety will be threatened,
wait until trained rescuers arrive.
Heat and smoke rise, so it is important to stay low when leaving a
smoke-filled room. Moving an injured or unconscious person should be
done quickly. Avoid using any method that might make the victim’s
injuries worse. A victim can be moved to safety with any of the rescuer
assists described in this chapter.

Transporting by Stretcher
When a person must be moved for
some distance or his or her injuries are
serious, you should carry the person on
a stretcher.
When available, use a litter or
rescue basket made especially for
transporting injured persons. If
none is available, make one of the
following improvised stretchers
and use the method shown in the
illustrations to place the victim on
the improvised stretcher:
Shirt stretcher. Make a stretcher
out of two poles (longer than the
victim is tall), for example, strong
branches, tool handles, oars, or
the poles from a wall tent.
Secure two Scout shirts (inside
out, with all the buttons but-
toned) over the poles to form a
stretcher. If possible, overlap
the bottoms of the shirts to
form a more secure bedding.
OVERLAP BOTTOMS
OF THE SHIRTS.


FIRST AID 29
.First-Aid Supplies and Skills
Blanket stretcher. Place a pole on the blanket. Fold over two-
fifths of the blanket. Place a second pole 6 inches from the edge
of the folded-over part. Bring the edge of the blanket over the
pole. Fold over the rest of the blanket. The person’s weight will
keep the blanket from unwinding.
Board stretcher. Use a surfboard, door, bench, or ironing
board to make this stretcher. A board stretcher is sturdier than a
blanket stretcher but heavier and less comfortable for the vic-
tim. When two rescuers carry a stretcher, have one or two other
rescuers, if available, walk at the sides to share the weight and
help keep the victim from rolling off.
Transporting someone by stretcher (or improvised
stretcher) can be difficult and exhausting work, requiring at
least four rescuers. Stretcher bearers should trade off with each
other to conserve their strength. At least one first aider should
stay by the victim’s head at all times to monitor the person’s
condition and note any changes.
To place someone on a stretcher or
improvised stretcher, have three rescuers
hold the victim straight and steady. A
fourth rescuer can slide the stretcher
beneath the victim. Gently place the victim
on the stretcher. The rescuers can lift and
carry the stretcher.
If only three rescuers are available,
they may try the hammock carry without
a stretcher. First, they should position
themselves at the victim’s shoulders, torso,
and legs to achieve full support. Then,
they should lift and carry the victim, being
sure to support the head, arms, and legs.
A stretcher can
be formed by
lashing three
metal pack frames
together. To work
well, the frames
must have roughly
the same width.
Use sleeping bags
for padding.





.Minor Wounds and Injuries
Minor Wounds
and Injuries
Although you should be prepared to deal with a wide range
of medical emergencies, your first-aid skills will probably be
put to use most often in the treatment of relatively minor
wounds and injuries. Remember to protect yourself with
nonlatex gloves and other precautions as needed, as well as by
washing your hands before and after treating your patient.
Bruises
The black-and-blue mark that is typical of a bruise is caused by
blood leaking into skin tissues, often as a result of a blow from
a blunt object. The skin is not broken. Some bruises are indica-
tors of more serious injuries including fractured bones or dam-
age to internal organs. This type of bruise requires the attention
of a medical doctor.
Most bruises, however, can be treated by a person trained
in first aid. To treat a bruise, place some ice (preferably) or a
refreezable gel pack into a plastic bag or damp cloth. Place a
towel or clean cloth over the bruised area and apply the ice
pack for periods of no more than 20 minutes. To avoid damage
to the skin, do not place the ice directly onto the skin. This
treatment will slow blood from leaking into the tissues.
Minimizing movement of the affected area also slows bleeding
into the bruise.


32 FIRST AID
Minor Wounds and Injuries.
To sterilize
tweezers, soak
them in rubbing
alcohol for a few
minutes. They
should be dry
before using them.
Another option is
to hold them over
a flame for a few
seconds, or place
them in boiling
water for a few
minutes; cool
before using.
Puncture Wounds
Puncture wounds can be caused by pins, splinters, nails, or
fishhooks. All easily can become infected because they are hard
to clean. To treat a puncture wound, help flush out dirt or
particles that might have been forced inside the wound when
the injury occurred by holding the injured area under clean,
running water for about five minutes. Use sterilized tweezers to
pull out splinters, bits of glass, or other small objects you can
see. If a large object is embedded, do not try to remove it.
Control any bleeding, apply a sterile dressing, and use gauze
pads and/or other soft materials to immobilize the object and
hold in place. Get the victim to a doctor.
Fishhook in the Skin
A fishhook embedded in the skin is a frequent outdoor injury.
Remember two things: Do not try to remove a fishhook from
the face or from an eye or an earlobe, and never try to remove
an embedded hook by pulling it back the way it went in unless
you are using the method shown below. Cut the fishing line
and, if possible, let a doctor remove the hook from the flesh. If
that isn’t possible, you might have to do the job yourself. First,
wash your hands with soap and warm water or use an alcohol-
based hand sanitizer. Wear nonlatex disposable gloves and pro-
tective eyewear to avoid contact with blood.
Step 1—Wrap a 3-foot length of fishing line around the bend
of the hook, as shown, and securely wrap the ends around your
index or middle finger.

Step 2—Keep the affected body part flat and stable, then gently
push down on the shank to free the barb from the injured
tissue. The shank should be parallel to the injured tissue.
Step 3—Keep bystanders well away from the area. Give the
line a quick, sharp jerk, and be careful to avoid getting snagged
by the outcoming hook.
Step 4—Wash and bandage the injury, and keep the wound
clean. Apply triple antibiotic ointment if there are no known
allergies or sensitivities to the medication. See a doctor as soon
as possible, because the risk of infection is high with this type
of injury.
2 3
If the hook has lodged so that the barb is visible above the skin,
try this method:
1. Cut off the barbed end with wire cutters or pliers.
2. Back the shank of the hook out through the entry wound.
Because the risk of infection is high with any type of puncture wound,
be sure to see a doctor as soon as possible.

Minor Wounds and Injuries.
Cuts and Scrapes (Abrasions)
Cuts may be caused by knives, razors, or broken glass. An abra-
sion is a wound that occurs as a result of the outer layers of the
skin being rubbed or scraped off. Abrasions may happen when
the skin is scraped against a hard surface, for example, when a
bicyclist falls onto the pavement. The wound may not bleed
very much. Sometimes dirt and gravel get ground into the abra-
sion, which increases the likelihood of infection.
To protect yourself from cuts and scrapes, dress appropri-
ately for the activity—for instance, jeans, boots, gloves, long-
sleeved shirt. A few simple precautions can help you avoid the
pain of the treatment and healing process.
Treat a minor cut or scrape by flushing the area with clean
water for at least five minutes, or until all foreign matter
appears to be washed away. You may need to scrub the area
gently. Apply triple antibiotic ointment if the person has no
known allergies or sensitivities to the medication and the
abrasion is smaller than the palm of your hand, and then cover
with a dry, sterile dressing and bandage or with an adhesive
bandage.


FIRST AID 35
.Minor Wounds and Injuries
Dressings and Bandages
After cleaning a wound in which the skin has been broken, protect it with
a dressing. A dressing is a protective covering placed over a wound that
helps to control bleeding and absorb blood and wound secretions. Sterile
dressings are free from germs and should be used to dress wounds
whenever possible. If a sterile dressing is not available, use the cleanest
cloth you have.
A bandage is a strip of material used to hold a dressing or splint in
place. It helps immobilize, support, and protect the injury. Common ban-
dages include rolls of gauze, elastic bandages, and triangular bandages.
Combination dressing-bandages include adhesive strips with attached
gauze pads.
If the victim complains of numbness or tingling in the fingers or toes,
the bandage is too tight and needs to be loosened. Swelling, color
changes or coolness of the fingers or toes also indicate that the bandage
needs to be loosened.
When using a bandage to secure a dressing, be sure not to wrap it
too tightly. Be sure the person’s fingertips or toes are accessible when a
splint or bandage is applied to the arm or leg so you can check for circula-
tion beyond the injury.
When the weather is cold, keep the victim’s hands and feet covered
with mittens or socks. Remove mittens or socks frequently to check that
circulation is not being restricted.
To dress and ban-
dage a wound, use
a dressing large
enough to extend
an inch or more
beyond the edge of
the wound. Hold the
dressing over the
wound and lower it
directly into place. If
the dressing slips
onto the surround-
ing skin before it
has been anchored,
discard it and use a
fresh dressing.


36 FIRST AID
Minor Wounds and Injuries.
Blisters on the Hand and Foot
Blisters are pockets of fluid that form when the skin is injured
by friction. Foot blisters are common injuries among backpack-
ers, whereas blisters on the hands might be more common
among canoeists. To help prevent foot blisters, wear shoes or
boots that fit, change socks if they become sweaty or wet, and
pay attention to how your feet feel. To help prevent blisters on
the hands, wear gloves for protection and pay attention to how
your hands feel.
A hot spot—the tender area as a blister starts to form—is a
signal to stop immediately. To treat a hot spot or blister, cover the
pinkish, tender area with a piece of moleskin or moleskin foam
slightly larger than the hot spot. Use several layers if necessary.
There are a couple of helpful products on the market—
SecondSkin™ and Blist-O-Ban™—that may be worth trying.
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions. During treatment it is
usually better to pad around—like in a donut shape—rather than
directly over the blister. Pads placed directly over the blister can
increase the pressure and possibly the friction. Change bandages
every day to help keep wounds clean and avoid infection.
If you must continue your activity even though you think a
small blister will burst, you might want to drain the fluid. First,
wash the skin with soap and water, then sterilize a pin in the
flame of a match. Prick the blister near its lower edge and press
out the fluid. Keep the wound clean with a sterile bandage or
gel pad and moleskin.
Blisters are best
left unbroken.
If a blister does
break, treat the
broken blister as
you would a minor
cut or abrasion.
People with
diabetes who
develop blisters
should see
a doctor.


FIRST AID 37
.Minor Wounds and Injuries
In some situations,
such as a
life-threatening
one, it might not
be possible or
practical to spend
15 or 20 seconds
washing your
hands. Do the
best you can,
and use your
good judgment.
Protection From
Bloodborne Pathogens
Whenever you provide first-aid care—no matter how
minor the wound or injury—you should take steps to
protect yourself and others. Bloodborne pathogens
such as viruses or bacteria can be transmitted from one
person to another and cause disease. Examples of dis-
eases that can be transmitted by contact with blood or
other bodily fluids include: the human immunodefi-
ciency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, and hepatitis B
and C viruses, which cause liver disease.
Recommendations from the Boy Scouts of America:
• Treat all blood as if it were contaminated with blood-
borne pathogens.
• Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and
warm water before and after treating a sick or
injured person.
• Never use your bare hands to stop bleeding. Use a
protective barrier, preferably nonlatex disposable
gloves (a new, unused plastic food storage bag will
work in a pinch).
• Safely discard all soiled gloves, bandages, dressings,
and other used first-aid items by putting them in a
double bag until they can be disposed of properly
in a receptacle for biohazards.
• Always wash your hands and other exposed skin
with soap and warm water or an alcohol-based hand
sanitizer immediately after treating a victim, even if
protective equipment was used.

Muscle, Joint, and Bone Injuries.
Muscle cramps
most often affect
the legs, but
they also can
occur in the
muscles of the
abdomen, ribs,
arms, and hands.
Muscle, Joint, and
Bone Injuries
Muscles, joints, and bones are all involved in helping the body
move. Falls, slips, collisions, and even fatigue and dehydration
can compromise or injure these body parts.
Muscle Cramps
A muscle cramp is a painful, involuntary contraction of a
muscle. The muscle tightens and does not easily relax. Cramps
tend to happen most frequently during heavy exercise in hot
weather. Dehydration and loss of electrolytes (potassium,
calcium, chloride, phosphate and sodium) might lead to
developing muscle cramps. Upon examination the cramping
muscle feels hard and might be lumpy. All attempts to stretch
the muscle are painful.
Allow a person experiencing muscle cramps to rest. Often a
cramp will disappear on its own in a few minutes. To help
recovery, gently massage the muscle and lightly stretch it. If the
weather is warm and the person has been exercising, be sure
the person rehydrates with water or, ideally, a sports drink that
will help the body and restore its proper electrolyte balance.
Decrease the likelihood of muscle cramps by staying
in good physical shape, stretching before exercising,
warming down, and drinking plenty of fluids before,
during, and after you work out.


FIRST AID 39
.Muscle, Joint, and Bone Injuries
Sprains and Strains
A sprain occurs when an ankle, wrist, or other joint is bent far
enough to overstretch the ligaments, the tough bands that hold
joints together. Twisting an ankle while running is one way a
person could sustain a sprain. A strain occurs when muscles
are overstretched, creating tears in the muscle fibers. Lower
back pain is often the result of muscles strained by overuse or
by lifting loads that are too heavy.
Minor sprains and strains cause only mild discomfort, but
more serious sprains and strains might be temporarily disabling.
A sprained joint will be tender and painful when moved and
might show swelling and discoloration. Strained backs, arms,
and legs will also be tender and can hurt if activity continues.
Assume that any injury to a joint also may include a bone.
Use the following procedure to treat sprains and strains and pre-
vent further injury. Have the victim take any weight off of the
injured joint and instruct the person not to use the joint. Do not
try to move or straighten an injured limb that is deformed. If,
however, the limb does straighten out during treatment, splint it
in the straightened position. Cover any open wounds with a ster-
ile dressing. Apply ice packs or cold compresses to the affected
area for no more than 20 minutes at a time. Be sure to place a
barrier such as a thin towel between the ice pack and bare skin.
Seek medical treatment if the pain is persistent or severe.
RICE
Use RICE for bone, joint, and muscle
injuries. Broken or dislocated bones
should also be splinted.
R = Rest. Stop using the injured part or
minimize its use. Sometimes a splint is
needed for adequate rest.
I = Ice. Apply cold as soon as possible
for 20 minutes and continue several
times a day as needed.
C = Compression. Apply an elastic ban-
dage to reduce swelling.
E = Elevation. If possible, keep the
injured part above the level of the heart
to reduce swelling and pain.

Sprains While Hiking
If someone suffers an ankle sprain during a hike and
your group must keep walking, do not remove the
hiking boot from the injured foot. The boot will help
support the ankle. If you do take the boot off, the
injury may swell so much it will not be possible to
get the boot back on. Reinforce the ankle by wrapping
it, boot and all, with a bandage, neckerchief, or some
other strip of cloth.
As soon as you have reached your destination,
have the person take off the boot. Treat with cold packs
and seek medical care.

See “Life-
Threatening
Emergencies” for
procedures to follow
in hurry cases.
Broken Bones
A fall, a violent blow, a collision, a twisting injury—all can
cause a fracture (a broken bone) or a dislocation. There are two
kinds of fractures: closed injuries, in which the skin over the
injury is intact, and open injuries, in which the skin has been
broken and there is a wound at the injury site. Open fractures
can occur when the sharp bone ends penetrate the skin or
when an object goes through the skin from the outside and
breaks the bone.
Most of the time a victim will have just one injury that is
not life threatening. After checking to rule out and treat the
“hurry cases,” do a quick, but complete, assessment of the
entire body, paying special attention for signs of a potential
spine injury. Begin treatment only after determining the number
and location of the injuries.
Begin by asking a series of questions. A “yes” answer sug-
gests that the person might have a fracture.
• Did you feel or hear a bone snap?
• Do you believe you have a fracture?
• Do you have tenderness directly over the suspected fracture?
Many people believe if they can move the part, the bone is
not broken. Not true. Although they might be reluctant to do
so, many people can voluntarily move a fractured part. The fact
that they can move does not mean that the bone is not broken.
Next check for DOTS: Deformity (look for an abnormal
shape or position of the limb); an Open wound; Tenderness
with direct pressure over the suspected fracture; Swelling.
There might not be bruising at the injury site.
Before administering first aid, you should try to obtain
the victim’s consent. If the victim is unconscious, disori-
ented, or otherwise appears unable to knowingly grant
consent, you can assume it is all right to proceed.


42 FIRST AID
Muscle, Joint, and Bone Injuries.
Closed (Simple) Fracture. A closed fracture (also known as a
simple fracture) is a broken bone that does not cut through the
skin. For a closed fracture, do the following.
• Evaluate the victim (especially the spine) and prepare to treat
all injuries.
• Call 911 or your local emergency-response number.
• Treat hurry cases—no movement and breathing for adults; no
movement, breathing, nor pulse for children) in children.
• Protect the spine until you are certain there is no spinal injury.
• Treat for shock (but avoid raising a leg that might be broken).
• Immobilize the fracture.
Open Fracture. An open fracture (also known as a compound
fracture) involves an open wound that could occur from either
the bone breaking the skin or an object going into the skin to
break the bone. Take the following actions for an open fracture.
• Evaluate the victim (especially the spine) and prepare to treat
all injuries.
• Call 911 or your local emergency-response number.
• Treat hurry cases—no signs of life (movement and breathing)
in adults; in children and infants, no signs of life and no pulse.
• Protect the spine until you are certain there is no spinal injury.
• Treat for shock (but avoid raising a leg that might be broken).
• Control bleeding with pressure but not so much pressure that
there is motion of the bone ends.
Do not try to
replace nor move
a bone that seems
to be sticking out
from the wound.
Open (compound) fracture
Closed (simple) fracture


FIRST AID 43
.Muscle, Joint, and Bone Injuries
• Place a sterile dressing over the wound (don’t wash the
wound).
• Do not try to push the bone ends back under the skin but
don’t worry if they go there on their own.
Whether you are treating a closed or an open fracture,
allow the person to lie where you found him or her, unless the
site poses an immediate hazard to the victim or rescuers. Make
the person comfortable by tucking blankets, sleeping bags, or
clothing under and over the body.
Dislocations
A dislocation occurs when one of the bones that come together
to form a joint gets knocked out of place. These are very pain-
ful injuries, and almost always there is a visible deformity. Any
attempt to move the joint causes severe pain.
Just like for fractures look for DOTS (see page 41).
For a dislocation:
• Evaluate the victim (especially the spine) and prepare to treat
all injuries
• Call 911 or the local emergency response number
• Protect the spine until you are certain that they don’t have a
spine injury
• Treat the person for shock (avoid raising a leg that might be
broken)
• Immobilize the joint in the position of deformity. This is often
done best with a soft splint such as pillow or rolled clothing;
it might involve splinting the joint in what would be consid-
ered an abnormal position.
• Do not try to put the joint back into place or straighten the
limb.
Just as with fractures, allow the person to lie where you
found him or her, unless the site poses an immediate hazard to
the victim or rescuers. Make the person as comfortable as
possible.


44 FIRST AID
Muscle, Joint, and Bone Injuries.
SPLINTS
Splinting a broken bone helps relieve pain and reduces the
chances of additional injury. A splint is any material, soft or
rigid, that can be bound to a fractured limb. Make the splint
long enough to immobilize the joints above, below, and on
either side of a fracture, as needed.
Make splints from whatever is handy—boards, branches,
blankets, hiking sticks, ski poles, shovel handles, or tent-pole
sections. Folded newspapers, magazines, or pieces of cardboard
or a sleeping pad will work, too. Take enough time to design
an effective splint and secure it with good knots to provide
enough support. It is a good idea to have a commercially avail-
able and lightweight Structural Aluminum Malleable (SAM®)
splint in your kit.
Some general principles of splinting:
• Don’t try to straighten a deformed limb
• For a fracture, immobilize both the joint above and the joint
below the fracture.
• For a dislocation immobilize the bone above and the bone
below the dislocation
• Place pads to immobilize the part and conform to the defor-
mity
• Avoid pressure over prominent regions
• Apply a sterile dressing over wounds that are under the
splint.
• Check for pulses below the splint shortly after the splint is
applied and at regular intervals after that. If the pulse gets
diminished, loosen the wrap over the splint.
Padding allows a splint to fit better and can make the vic-
tim more comfortable. Cushion a splint with clothing, blankets,
pillows, crumpled paper, or other soft material. Hold the splints
and padding in place with neckerchiefs, handkerchiefs, roller
bandages, or other wide strips of cloth, as shown.
The saying “splint
it where it lies”
is usually
good advice.

HOW TO SPLINT AN INJURED LIMB
Splint all fractures and suspected fractures in the same position
as you found them. Do not try to straighten or reposition the
injured area.
Step 1—Keep the area above and below
the injury still and stable.
Step 2—Check for circulation (feeling,
warmth, color).
Step 3—Extend splints beyond the joint
above and the joint below the suspected
injury. Minimize movement while apply-
ing splints by providing support above
and below the fracture.
Step 4—Secure splints with bandages,
neckerchiefs, or other wide strips of
cloth. Tie at least one place above the
injured area and one below. Do not tie
bandages directly over the injury itself or
over a joint.
Step 5—After the splint is in place,
recheck for circulation (feeling, warmth,
color) to make sure you haven’t cut off
circulation. If the pulse gets diminished,
loosen the wrap over the splint.

Step 2—Without removing the shoe, carefully check for circu-
lation (feeling, warmth, color).
Step 3—Position several triangular bandages, as shown, under
the injured area.
Step 4—Gently wrap something soft (small blanket or towel)
around the injured area, as shown.
Step 5—Tie the triangular bandages in place securely with knots.
Step 6—Recheck the area for circulation (feeling, warmth,
color). No circulation is an indication that the bandage is too
tight and should be loosened.

Lower-leg fracture. Use splints that are long enough to reach
from the middle of the thigh to past the heel. Place one splint
on each side of the injured limb and bind them together. Tying
the legs together adds additional support.
Upper-leg fracture. Apply two padded splints, one outside the
leg extending from heel to armpit, the other inside the leg from
the heel to the crotch. Bind the splints together. Tying the legs
together adds additional support.
The muscles of the upper leg are strong enough to pull
the ends of a broken thigh bone into the flesh, some-
times causing serious internal bleeding that may pose
a threat to the victim’s life. For this reason, in addition
to the first aid described here for a thigh bone (femur)
fracture, treat this injury as a hurry case. Call for medi-
cal help immediately. Keep the victim still and quiet.
Control any bleeding, and treat for shock.

SLINGS
Slings help support an injured hand, arm, collarbone,
or shoulder.
Step 1—Support the injured limb above and below
the injured area.
Step 2—Check the injured area for circulation
(feeling, warmth, color). Reposition the sling
if necessary.

Step 3—Position a triangular sling (such as a folded Scout
neckerchief or a large triangular bandage) across the chest as
shown. If one is available, place a clean gauze bandage over
the side of the neck for comfort, at the area where the sling
will be knotted.
Step 4—Bring the upper free end of the sling behind the neck
and the lower free corner upward (as shown) and tie the ends
together with a square knot, forming the sling.
Step 5—To keep the injured area more stable, bind the sling to the
chest using a second triangular bandage. Roll the bandage up as
shown. Comfortably but not too loosely position the bandage
above the injured area, over the sling and across the victim’s front.
Step 6—Bring one end of the rolled-up bandage under the
victim’s uninjured arm and the other side around the back (6a).
Tie the ends together with a square knot and put a clean
gauze pad under the knot for comfort (6b).
Step 7—Recheck the injured area for feeling, warmth,
and color. If the pulse gets diminished, loosen the wrap over
the splint.
Cravat Bandage
To make a cravat bandage from a Scout
neckerchief or triangular bandage:
1. Fold the point up to the long edge.
2. Finish by folding the bottom edge
several times toward the top edge.
3. Tie all bandages in place with
square knots.
Upper-arm fracture. Tie a splint to the out-
side of the upper-arm. Place the arm in a
sling with the hand raised about 3 inches
above level, then use a cravat bandage to
hold the upper arm against the side of the
chest. The body will act as a splint to
immobilize the elbow and shoulder.


50 FIRST AID
Muscle, Joint, and Bone Injuries.
Neck and Back Injuries
The backbone (spinal column) is made up of small bones called
vertebrae that surround and protect the spinal cord. If a verte-
bra is broken or dislocated, the spinal cord may be injured.
Fractures of the neck and back are extremely dangerous,
because movement might further damage the spinal cord and
cause permanent paralysis or even death.
Whenever someone has fallen, been involved in an
automobile accident, or suffered a blow to the head, assume
there is an injury to the neck or back. Such injuries are often
not easy to detect. The victim may or may not be suffering
from pain, paralysis, cuts and bruises, or swelling. The injured
area may be deformed or abnormally shaped, or there may
be no symptoms at all. Always proceed with great caution
when you are aiding a person whom you suspect has
neck or back injuries.
Collarbone or shoulder fracture. Place the
forearm in a sling with the hand raised
higher than the elbow, then tie the upper
arm against the side of the body with a
wide cravat bandage. No further splinting
is necessary.
Lower-arm fracture. Splint to hold the
hand and forearm motionless. Placing
the splinted arm in a sling with the
hand slightly raised will also immobi-
lize the elbow joint.


FIRST AID 51
.Muscle, Joint, and Bone Injuries
When you suspect an injury to the neck or back, follow
these steps.
Step 1—Stabilize the head and neck of the victim until it can be
determined whether the spinal column has been injured. A first
aider or a bystander can hold the victim’s head and neck steady.
If the person is wearing a helmet, do not remove it unless it is
necessary to access the person’s airway.
Step 2—Provide urgent treatment if necessary.
Step 3—Do not move the person or let him or her move unless
threatened by an immediate danger such as fire, potential
avalanche, or highway traffic.
Step 4—If the victim is having trouble breathing, gently adjust
the position of the head and neck just enough to maintain an
open airway. Do not put a pillow under the head.
Step 5—Treat for shock but do not unnecessarily change the
victim’s position.
Whenever you suspect neck or back injuries and the victim
must be moved (to open an airway, for example, or to get the
person out of the path of danger), ask other Scouts or bystand-
ers to help so that the victim’s body can be turned or lifted all
at once without causing any twists or turns.
It is safe to suspect possible neck or back injury when
the victim
• Has been in a motor vehicle crash
• Has fallen from higher than a standing height
• Is or was wearing a safety helmet that is broken
• Complains of neck or back pain
• Feels tingling or weakness in the fingers or toes
• Is not fully alert
• Appears to be confused or drunk

FIRST AID 53
.Cold- and Heat-Related Conditions and Injuries
Cold- and Heat-Related
Conditions and Injuries
The human body works best if it has a constant temperature of
98.6 degrees. A person who is exposed to cold environmental
conditions and loses body heat faster than it can be generated
will be in grave danger. The person’s body temperature may
become too low to support life. Likewise, a person whose body
has overheated and cannot cool itself sufficiently may die if fast
emergency medical care cannot be found. These temperature-
related emergencies require fast, lifesaving first aid.
Hypothermia
Hypothermia occurs when a person’s body is losing more heat
than it can generate. It is a danger for anyone who is not
dressed warmly enough, although exposure to cold is seldom
the only cause. Dehydration is a common contributing factor to
hypothermia. Wind, rain, hunger, and exhaustion can further
compound the danger. Temperatures do not need to be below
freezing, either. A hiker caught out in a cool, windy rain
shower without proper rain gear can be at great risk. A swim-
mer too far out in chilly water or a paddler who capsizes also is
at risk for hypothermia.


.Cold- and Heat-Related Conditions and Injuries.
If one person is
being treated for
hypothermia, the
rest of a group
might also be at
risk. Protect your-
selves by taking
shelter, putting on
layers of warm
clothing, and hav-
ing something to
eat and something
warm to drink.
First Aid for Hypothermia
A hypothermia victim may experience numbness, fatigue, irrita-
bility, slurred speech, uncontrollable shivering, poor judgment
or decision making, and loss of consciousness. Shivering that
stops without rewarming is a sign that the person’s condition is
worsening. He or she needs immediate medical care.
Treat a hypothermia victim by preventing the person from
getting colder. After summoning help, use any or all of the
following methods to help bring the body temperature back
up to normal:
• If fully conscious and able to swallow, have the person
drink warm liquids (soup, fruit juices, water; no caffeine
or alcohol).
• Move the person into the shelter of a building or a tent.
Remove wet clothing. Get him or her into dry, warm clothes
or wrap the person in blankets, clothing, or anything handy
that could be used, like jackets or a sleeping bag.
• Wrap towels around water bottles filled with warm fluid,
then position the bottles in the armpit and groin areas.
• Monitor the person closely for any change in condition.
Do not rewarm the person too quickly (for instance, by
immersing the person in warm water); doing so can cause
an irregular and dangerous heartbeat.
Frostbite
Frostbite is a condition that occurs when skin is exposed to
temperatures cold enough that ice crystals begin to form in the
tissues. A frostbite victim might complain that the ears, nose,
fingers, or feet feel painful and then numb, but sometimes the
person will not notice any such sensation. Grayish-white
patches on the skin—indicating that ice crystals have begun
to form in the top layers of the skin—are signals of the first
stage of frostbite, or frostnip. With continued exposure, frostnip
worsens and the freezing extends to deeper layers of the skin
and to the muscles. Frostbite can be very serious, as it can
cut off blood flow to the affected area and lead to gangrene,
or tissue death.
Far from the warmth of the body’s core, toes and
fingers are especially vulnerable, as are the nose,
ears, and cheeks.


FIRST AID 55
..Cold- and Heat-Related Conditions and Injuries
First Aid for Frostbite
If you suspect that frostbite extends below skin level, remove
wet clothing and wrap the injured area in a dry blanket. Get the
victim under the care of a physician as soon as possible. Do not
massage the area or rub it with snow. Rewarm the area only
if there is no chance of refreezing. Expose the affected area
to warm (100 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit) water until normal
color returns and it feels warm, and bandage the area loosely
(placing dry, sterile gauze between fingers and toes).
To treat frostnip, move the victim into a tent or building,
then warm the injured area. If an ear or cheek is frozen,
remove a glove and warm the injury with the palm of your
hand. Slip a frostnipped hand under your clothing and tuck it
beneath an armpit. Treat frostnipped toes by putting the vic-
tim’s bare feet against the warm skin of your belly.
Dehydration
The human body is 70 percent water, which is essential to
maintain our body temperature. Vital organs like the brain and
the kidneys will not function well without enough
water. We lose water mostly by breathing,
sweating, digestion, and urination. When
we lose more water than we take in,
we become dehydrated. People with mild
dehydration usually complain of fatigue,
increased thirst, dry lips, and dark yellow
urine. The complaints of people with
moderate to severe dehydration
include severe thirst, dry mouth with
little saliva, dry skin, weakness,
dizziness, confusion, nausea,
fainting, muscle cramps, loss of
appetite, decreased sweating
(even with exertion), decreased
urine production, and less fre-
quent and dark brown urine.
Dehydration increases the danger of frostbite, so cold-
weather travelers must be just as diligent about drink-
ing fluids as they are when the weather is hot.
The importance of
drinking plenty of
fluids cannot be
overemphasized.
Do not wait until
you feel thirsty—
thirst is an
indication you are
already becoming
dehydrated.


56 FIRST AID
.Cold- and Heat-Related Conditions and Injuries.
Dehydration can
play a significant
role in a number of
serious conditions,
including heat
exhaustion, heat-
stroke, hypothermia,
and frostbite.
Dehydration can
happen in hot-
and cold-weather
conditions.
First Aid for Dehydration
To treat mild dehydration, drink plenty of water or a sports
drink to replace fluids and minerals. Drink one to two quarts
(or liters) of liquids over two to four hours. See a physician for
moderate or severe dehydration. Severe dehydration requires
emergency care; the victim will need intravenous fluids. Rest
for 24 hours and continue drinking fluids. Avoid tiring physical
activity. Although most people begin to feel better within a few
hours, it takes about 36 hours to completely restore the fluids
lost in dehydration.
Heat Exhaustion
Heat exhaustion can be brought on by a combination of dehydra-
tion, exercise, and a warm environment. Heat exhaustion is not
uncommon during outdoor activities conducted in hot weather,
especially if participants are not fully acclimated to the condi-
tions. People with heat exhaustion usually complain that they
feel really bad. Lack of energy, generalized weakness, inattention,
inability to concentrate, headache, nausea, faintness, and exces-
sive sweating are some of the signs of heat exhaustion.
Examination reveals cool, pale, moist skin and a rapid pulse.
First Aid for Heat Exhaustion
Because dehydration is a major component of heat exhaustion,
it is very important for the person to rehydrate. Get the person
in the shade (or an air-conditioned vehicle or building).
Encourage him or her to drink fluids, such as cool water or a
sports drink. Apply cool, wet towels or cloths to the skin, wet
the person’s clothing with cool water, and fan the person to
help the cooling process. Raising the legs may help prevent a
feeling of faintness when the person stands. Usually after two
or three hours of rest and fluids, the victim will feel better but
should rest for the remainder of the day and be extra careful
about staying hydrated.

FIRST AID 57
..Cold- and Heat-Related Conditions and Injuries
Heatstroke
Heatstroke—much more serious than heat exhaustion—can lead
to death if not treated immediately. Left untreated, heat exhaus-
tion can develop into heatstroke. In heatstroke, the body’s cool-
ing system begins to fail and the person’s core temperature rises
to life-threatening levels (above 105 degrees). One type of heat-
stroke develops in young, healthy people from dehydration
and overexertion in hot weather, especially in high humidity.
The first sign of true heat stroke is often collapse. On a hot day,
if someone collapses without warning, you must consider heat-
stroke. Besides coma, someone with exercise-related heatstroke
often has many of the same signs and symptoms as heat
exhaustion as well confusion, disorientation, a rapid pulse,
shallow breathing, vomiting, and seizures. People with heat-
stroke will have hot skin. In some cases the skin might be red.
The skin could be wet or dry.
The other type of heatstroke usually happens in elderly peo-
ple when the weather is very hot, especially with high humidity.
The signals are similar to exercise-related heatstroke except that
the skin is hot and dry because there is no sweating.
First Aid for Heatstroke
Heatstroke is a life-threatening condition. Call for medical
assistance immediately. While waiting for medical per-
sonnel to arrive, work to lower the victim’s temperature.
Move the person to an air-conditioned or shady area.
Loosen tight clothing and further cool the victim by
fanning and applying wet towels. If possible, immerse
or spray the person with cold water. If you have ice
packs, wrap them in a thin barrier (such as a thin towel)
and place them under the armpits and against the neck
and groin. If the person is able to drink, give small
amounts of cool water.
FIRST AID 57


Burns
A spark from a campfire, boiling water spilled from a pot, a
faulty wire, a mishap with chemicals in a science class, the rays
of the sun on bare skin—the causes of burns are many. Burns
are generally characterized by degree, or the severity of the skin
and tissue damage.
Superficial (First-Degree) Burns
Mild burns, such as you might get from touching a baking dish
that has just come out of an oven, will cause a painful reddening
of the skin. Such burns are classified as superficial, or first-degree
burns—they affect only the outer layer of skin, or epidermis.
Treat them by holding the burn under cold water or applying
cool, wet compresses until the pain eases. Superficial burns do
not usually require further medical treatment unless they cover
more than 20 to 25 percent of the body.
Remember to check the scene before you proceed.
Always get a victim away from the source of a burn
before proceeding with treatment.
Sunburn is
the most
common type of
superficial burn.
58 FIRST AID


FIRST AID 59
.Burns
Partial-Thickness (Second-Degree) Burns
A partial-thickness (second-degree) burn affects the epidermis
and part of the layer of skin below it, the dermis. Partial-
thickness burns are more serious than superficial burns and
typically include a reddening and blistering of the skin. Being
scalded by boiling water is an example of an accident that
could result in partial-thickness burns. To treat such burns,
first remove the person from the source of the burn. Cool the
burned area with cold, running water until the pain is relieved.
Let the burn dry, then protect it with a loosely applied, sterile
gauze pad and bandage.
Do not apply ice
or ice water to
any burn. Doing so
may cause the
body to lose
heat rapidly and
further damage
body tissues.
While the general public continues to be more familiar with the terms
“first degree,” “second degree,” and “third degree” to classify burns, med-
ical professionals identify burns by their “thickness.” For instance, minor
(first-degree) burns are called superficial. Those that cause blistering of
the skin (second-degree) are called partial-thickness burns. The most seri-
ous burns (third-degree) are called full-thickness burns.
Partial thicknessSuperficial Full thickness
Get immediate medical treatment for the victim if
the burns
• Cause trouble breathing
• Cover more than one body part or a large surface
• Have caused possible burns to the airway (such as
burns to the mouth and nose)
• Affect the eyes, head, neck, hands, feet, or genitalia
• Are full thickness and the victim is younger than
age 5 or older than age 60
• Are the result of chemicals, explosions, or electricity


60 FIRST AID
Burns.
Never break
burn blisters.
Doing so will
create an open
wound that may
become infected.
Do not apply
butter, creams,
ointments, or
sprays—they are
difficult to remove
and may slow the
healing process.
Full-Thickness (Third-Degree) Burns
Full-thickness (third-degree) burns are very serious and poten-
tially life threatening. They destroy the epidermis and the der-
mis. A victim who has been exposed to open flames, electricity,
or chemicals may sustain full-thickness burns. The skin may be
burned away and the flesh charred. In the case of burns, the
absence of pain and tenderness is a bad sign because it means
that the burn has penetrated multiple layers of skin and dam-
aged the deeper tissues and nerves. Such burns constitute a
medical emergency. Do not try to remove any clothing, as it
may be sticking to the victim’s flesh. Cool the burn by applying
cold, moist cloths. After cooling the burn, cover the burned
area with dry, sterile dressings, treat for shock, and seek imme-
diate medical attention.
Do not use any kind of ointment on a severe burn.
Treat thermal burns like this scalded forearm by running
the affected area under cool running water, or by apply-
ing cool, wet compresses. Cover the area loosely with a
sterile gauzepad and bandage.

FIRST AID 61
Chemical Burns
Chemical burns can be caused by exposure
of the skin or eyes to substances that are
strong acids or strong bases such as model
glue, drain cleaners, toilet-bowl cleaners,
metal cleaners, and battery acid.
Here are steps for treating a chemical burn.
Step 1—Using gloves or a piece of cloth, brush off pow-
dered chemicals from the victim’s skin. Remove any of the
victim’s clothing with chemicals on it. Do not contaminate
yourself in the process.
Step 2—Immediately flood the affected area with cool, clean
water. Continue flushing the wound for at least 20 minutes to
remove traces of the chemical.
Step 3—If the chemical got into the eyes,
flush the eyes with clean water. It may be
easier to have the victim lie down while
flushing the eyes with water. Act as quickly
as possible. Continue flushing for at least
15 minutes, or until emergency medical
professionals arrive.
Step 4—Cover the burns loosely with sterile
dressings or gauze.
Step 5—Get medical help by calling 911 or
your local emergency-response number
immediately. If you know the name of the
product or substance that caused the burn,
be sure to inform emergency workers.
The damage from a chemical burn can take hours—
even days—to fully develop. For this reason, it is ini-
tially difficult to evaluate the extent of the burn. The
most important first aid for a chemical burn is to dilute
the exposure by continuously flushing the area with
water for at least 15 to 20 minutes, or until emergency
medical help arrives. Remember also that inhaling
chemicals can damage your airway and lungs, too.

62 FIRST AID
Burns.
Never touch
a person who
is in contact with
a live electrical
power source.
Electrical Burns
If electricity travels through a part of your body, you can get an
electrical burn. Besides a burn, too much electricity can even
stop the heart from beating correctly or damage other internal
organs. Superficial and partial-thickness burns from electricity
look like burns from too much heat; the skin may look charred.
Full-thickness electrical burns may not leave charred skin.
Instead, the skin can look leathery and white and be hard to
the touch. Call 911 or the local emergency-response number if
someone has an electrical burn.
If you encounter a victim of an electrical burn, shut off the
power at its source, and call an ambulance immediately. Check
the scene for safety, then take the following steps:
Step 1—Begin CPR and get the automated external defibrillator
(if available) if the victim is not breathing or moving. (See
“Life-Threatening Emergencies.”)
Step 2—Cover burns with sterile gauze pads. Cool electrical
burns as for thermal burns.
Step 3—Treat for shock.
Burns From Dry Chemicals
As long as the dry chemical is on the skin, it will con-
tinue to burn. So, it’s important to quickly brush off as
much of the chemical as possible using a gloved hand.
Then flush the area with tap water, taking care not to
recontaminate the victim or to contaminate yourself.


FIRST AID 63
.Burns
Sunburn
Sunburn is a common injury among people who enjoy being outdoors.
Most sunburns are first-degree burns, but prolonged exposure to the
sun can cause blistering—a second-degree burn. Repeated sunburns
over a long period of time can cause skin damage and increase the risk
of skin cancer. People with lighter skin are most at risk, although others
are not immune.
Treat painful sunburn as for any heat burn or with cool, damp or wet
cloths; change the cloths frequently. Prevent further injury by getting the
person under shade. If no shade is available or you are out on a hiking or
boating trip, have the person wear a brimmed hat, pants, and a long-
sleeved shirt for protection from the sun.
It is best to prevent sunburn. Whenever you are outdoors, use plenty of
sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) rating of at least 15. Apply
sunscreen liberally about a half-hour before sunlight exposure and
reapply every two hours, especially if you are sweating or have been in
water. A broad-brimmed hat, long-sleeved shirt, and long pants provide
even more protection.
Remember this: It’s easy to forget the sunscreen in wintry conditions.


64 FIRST AID
Other First-Aid Cases.
Other First-Aid Cases
As a first aider, you will encounter many relatively minor cases.
Nevertheless, always take all injuries, illnesses, or conditions
seriously. They can suggest a more serious health threat.
Abdominal pain, for example, could be among the first indica-
tions of appendicitis. A fainting spell could occur as a result of
a heart attack, stroke, or internal bleeding.
Many people have heath conditions such as diabetes or
epilepsy. Signals of these conditions can flare up unexpectedly
and may require first aid. Whenever you prepare for a group
outing such as a camping or canoeing trip, find out if any par-
ticipants have such conditions and have them inform group
leaders of their health histories, treatment regimens, medica-
tions, and the locations of those medications.
Fainting
Fainting is a brief loss of consciousness. It usually occurs
because there is temporary loss of blood flow to the brain. It
can be caused by getting up too quickly or standing too long,
by overheating or dehydration, by emotional stress such as
fright or bad news, or by severe pain.
Fainting can occur suddenly, or there might first be signals
such as dizziness, nausea, paleness, sweating, numbness and
tingling of the hands or feet, vision blackout or whiteout, and
coldness of the skin. The victim might fall to the ground. If
a person begins to feel faint, have him or her sit down with
the head between the knees or lie down and raise the legs
about 12 inches.
Sometimes fainting
is a signal of
a more serious
condition such as
an irregular heart-
beat, heart valve
problems, or
internal bleeding.
Any important medical
information should be
included on a medical
ID bracelet.


FIRST AID 65
.Other First-Aid Cases
Someone who has fainted should be encouraged to stay
lying down until he or she completely awakens and feels better.
Raise the feet and legs about 12 inches. Make sure the person’s
breathing passage (airway) stays open. If the victim begins to
vomit while lying down, turn the person onto one side and
keep the airway clear. Support the head with a pillow or let the
victim rest it on one arm. Loosen clothing around the neck.
Wipe the victim’s forehead with a cool, wet cloth. If the person
is alert enough and might be dehydrated, give fluids to drink. If
the person does not awaken within two minutes, or fully
recover with a few minutes, get medical help.
Hyperventilation
Hyperventilation happens when you are breathing
faster and deeper than your body needs. Involuntary
(or unintentional) hyperventilation might be caused by
emotional stress, severe pain, infection, severe
bleeding, heart attack, cold water immersion, diabetic
coma, or poisoning. The victim can feel dizzy or faint,
and have numbness, tingling, and/or cramping in the
fingers and toes. Involuntary hyperventilation usually
requires immediate medical attention. Voluntary (or
deliberate) hyperventilation is unhealthy and can be
dangerous, especially if it is followed by breath
holding. A person who does this can pass out or faint
from lack of oxygen before feeling the need to breathe.
If this occurs while a person is underwater, the result
can be drowning. Be alert to abnormal breathing
patterns in individuals.
Management of hyperventilation includes taking
the person to a quiet place to calm down. Encourage
them to breath slowly. One suggestion is to have them
breathe in through the nose and hold the breath for a
couple of seconds before exhaling. There is some
controversy about having them breathe into a paper
bag; this might help, but it should only be used for a
minute or two.


66 FIRST AID
Other First-Aid Cases.
Loss of Consciousness
A loss of consciousness for more than two minutes is a serious
medical condition. An unconscious person might have been hit
in the head or had a heart attack or stroke. People with diabe-
tes can lose consciousness from either very high or very low
blood sugar. Look for an emergency medical ID bracelet or
necklace or an information card that identifies health problems
such as diabetes. Follow the instructions on the card exactly.
Whenever a person is unconscious for more than a minute
or two, call 911 or your local emergency-response number for
medical assistance. Check to see if the person is breathing
and for other signs of life. Begin CPR if appropriate. If there
has been an accident, protect the victim’s head and neck
from movement.
If the unconscious person has not been involved in an acci-
dent, look around the scene for evidence of poisoning, drug use,
or other possible causes for the loss of consciousness. If you
suspect poison or drugs were involved, take or send the con-
tainer or suspected poison to the emergency room with the vic-
tim. If the victim recovers before medical personnel arrive, he or
she should seek medical advice as soon as possible. Any loss of
consciousness after a head injury, even if only for a short time,
requires immediate evaluation by a health-care professional.
Seizures
A seizure is a change in awareness or behavior that is caused
by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. In adults and chil-
dren over age 6, seizures are usually due to epilepsy, a disorder
of the brain. A seizure could be a signal of a serious medical
problem. Seizures can occur in a person who is suffering from a
head injury, brain tumor, stroke, poisoning, electrical shock,
heatstroke, infection, a high fever (usually in children), low
blood sugar, or low blood pressure.
Epilepsy may be the cause of a seizure. There are several
common forms of epilepsy. In grand mal epilepsy (also known
as tonic/clonic seizure), the victim may lose consciousness and
fall to the ground. The arms and legs stiffen then jerk forcefully.
Some muscles or the entire body can stiffen or twitch with
sudden muscle spasms known as convulsions. The victim may
bite the tongue. Do not put anything in the victim’s mouth;
victims will rarely bite their tongues with enough force to
cause bleeding.
Taking too
many drugs or
drinking too
much alcohol
can make a
person lose
consciousness.
Never give an
unconscious
person anything
to drink, throw
water on the face,
or offer stimulants
such as smelling
salts. Do not
shake or slap the
person in an effort
to wake him or
her up.


FIRST AID 67
.Other First-Aid Cases
Neck veins may be swollen and the face may turn red or
blue. Breathing may decrease and is often loud and labored,
accompanied by grunts or snorts with an unusual hissing
sound. The victim may drool or foam at the mouth
and may lose bladder or bowel control.
Another kind of epileptic seizure is the petit mal seizure in
which the person seems to briefly lose awareness of his or her
surroundings and appears to stare into space. This behavior is
often mistaken for daydreaming. Although awake, the individ-
ual does not respond normally. Afterward, the person does not
recall the episode. Focal seizures cause one part of the body to
jerk or twitch, and the person seems distant or unaware.
Seizures are frightening to observe. While there is no first-
aid measure that will stop a seizure, you can provide good first
aid by protecting the person from being injured while experi-
encing a seizure. Break the person’s fall, if possible, and lower
him or her gently to the floor or ground.
Step 1—Move away any furniture and hard or sharp objects
that could cause injury. Avoid moving the person unless there is
potential danger nearby—a fireplace, stairway, glass door,
swimming pool, or other hazard.
Step 2—Loosen tight clothing around the neck and waist.
Step 3—Do not try to hold the person. Trying to restrain
someone during a seizure risks injury to that person and to
the first aider.
Step 4—Do not force anything into the mouth or between
the teeth.
Step 5—Make sure the airway is open after the seizure has
stopped. Do not try to open the airway during the seizure.
Step 6—When the seizure is over, place the person in a
recovery position.
Step 7—Let the person rest. Keep curious onlookers away.
Step 8—If the person is not known to have epilepsy, if the
seizure lasts more than five minutes, recurs, or causes injury,
or if the person is slow to recover, call 911 or your local
emergency-response number. Call for emergency assistance
immediately if a seizure victim is pregnant, has diabetes,
remains unconscious after the seizure ends, has been injured,
or has swallowed large amounts of water (as a result of a water
accident).
Epilepsy is
controlled by

Recovery Position
Place a victim who is unconscious but who is breathing
normally in a recovery position. To do this, extend the
person’s arm farthest from you up next to the head in
line with his or her body; bend the leg nearest you up;
support the head and neck as you grasp the victim’s hip
and shoulder; and roll the person away from you so that
he or she is lying on the side. This will prevent the per-
son from choking on saliva, blood (from a bitten
tongue), or vomit, and will help keep the airway open.
Continue to monitor the person’s breathing until medi-
cal help arrives.

Diabetes
Diabetes is a disorder that impairs the body’s ability to control
its blood sugar level. In some cases, the body stops making
insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use sugar for
energy. Some people who have diabetes must inject insulin to
live. People with diabetes who do not have to use insulin can
keep their blood sugar at the proper levels by watching what
they eat and taking other diabetes-controlling medications.
When a diabetic person’s blood-sugar level is too high or
too low, the person can become unconscious. This is a diabetic
emergency. A very high blood sugar level (hyperglycemia) will
rarely cause death; a low blood sugar level (hypoglycemia) is
extremely dangerous because without sugar, brain cells die
quickly and permanent brain damage can result.
Because it is impossible to know if there is too much or too
little sugar without doing a blood test, all people with diabetes
who are having a reaction should be treated as though their
blood sugar levels are too low. This is done by giving them sugar
in some form. Glucose tables should be in the unit’s first-aid kit
if someone in the unit has diabetes. The person with diabetes
should also have some sort of sugar with them at all times. Often
this is hard candy or some form of concentrated sugar to be
taken orally. Follow the instructions exactly.
A person with diabetes might be wearing a medical ID
necklace or bracelet or have a card explaining what should be
done during a diabetic emergency.
A person with diabetes who uses insulin sometimes has a
low blood sugar level without becoming unconscious. This can
happen if they take too much insulin, don’t eat enough food,
exercise a lot without eating a snack, or if they decrease their
dose of insulin ahead of time or wait too long between meals.
With mild cases of hypoglycemia like these (and the victim is
fully conscious and able to safely swallow food or drinks), give
the victim fruit juice or a soft drink that contains sugar (nondiet).
Warning signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include
headache; sweating; pale, moist skin; weakness;
dizziness; shallow breathing; nervousness; and a rapid
pulse. Signals of hyperglycemia include extreme thirst,
frequent urination, drowsiness, lack of appetite, and
labored breathing.
Hypoglycemia is
also called
insulin reaction
or insulin shock.

your eyes by wear-
ing sunglasses.
Foreign Object in the Eye
Something in the eye is not just painful—it could endanger
eyesight. The National Society to Prevent Blindness says that
90 percent of all eye damage is preventable. To protect your
eyes, always wear safety glasses or goggles when using power
tools, lawn and garden equipment, and other machinery that
slings dirt and debris. Be careful not to let fumes from solvents
and cleaning agents burn your eyes.
If a foreign object gets in the eye, do not rub the eye; rubbing
might scratch the cornea (the clear covering of the colored part of
the eye). Have the person blink the eyes; tears might flush out the
object. If that doesn’t work, wash your hands with soap and
water, then try to flush out the foreign particles with clean running
water or clean water poured from a glass or bottle.
Foreign matter that is embedded in the eye or that will not
wash out must be treated by a physician. Stabilize the object if
possible and cover the injured eye with a dry, sterile gauze pad.
An eye patch helps reduce eye motion which can increase
damage from an object in the eye. Take the person to a doctor.
Nosebleeds
Nosebleeds might look bad, but the bleeding normally is not
very serious unless it occurs without trauma in an adult.
Nosebleeds will usually stop in just a few minutes. The bleed-
ing usually stems from a small vein in the nose and can be
caused by irritation to the area from colds, allergies, picking,
cold and dry weather, and overuse of nose drops or sprays.


FIRST AID 71
.Other First-Aid Cases
Have the victim sit leaning slightly forward so the blood
does not run down the throat. Ask the person to use thumb and
forefinger to pinch the nose firmly but gently, and apply pressure
on the upper lip, just below the nose. Placing a rolled-up gauze
or tissue under the upper lip can help. While the person is pinch-
ing, apply a cold compress to the nose and surrounding area.
After about 10 minutes, have the person slowly release the
nose pinch. If the bleeding reappears, pinch the nose and apply
pressure once again. After the bleeding stops, do not irritate,
pick, or blow the nose for several hours. If the bleeding contin-
ues for more than 15 minutes, seek medical attention.
Spontaneous nosebleeds in adults are uncommon and might
indicate an underlying health condition. Any adult who has a
nosebleed without a blow to the nose should seek medical care.
For Poisoning,
Call 800-222-1222
A poison is a drug, chemical, or toxic liquid that can
cause illness or death if swallowed. Any drug or medi-
cine can be poisonous if not taken according to a
doctor’s instructions or the directions on the label.
Many cosmetics, cleaning products, pesticides, paints,
and other household products also contain chemicals
that may be harmful if swallowed.
Call the Poison Control Center toll-free at
800-222-1222 if you have a poisoning emergency. Keep
this number handy. Meanwhile, follow these steps.
Step 1—Immediately take any poison containers to a
telephone. Call the poison control center toll-free at
800-222-1222, or 911, or your local emergency response
number (if a life-threatening condition such as uncon-
sciousness, a change in consciousness, or no breathing
is found), and follow the instructions you are given.
Step 2—Treat the victim for shock and monitor breath-
ing. Do not give anything by mouth unless you are told
to do so by medical professionals.
Step 3—Save any vomit (use a bowl, cook pot, or plas-
tic bag). It will help a physician identify the poison and
give the right treatment.

Poisonous Plants
The oily sap from the leaves, stem, and roots of poison ivy, poi-
son oak, and poison sumac irritates the skin of most people.
Once the sap gets on skin, it can spread to other parts of the
body and cause a rash with redness, blisters, swelling, itching,
burning, fever, and headache. The severity of the reaction
depends on the individual and the extent of the exposure. The
best form of prevention is to learn how to recognize the poison-
ous plants in your area and to avoid contact with them.
Learn what poisonous plants look like and stay away
from them. “Leaflets three, let it be” might help you
remember to avoid plants that have leaflets grouped
in threes, such as poison ivy. White berries are another
signal of poisonous plants, although not all plants with
three leaves or white berries are poisonous. Wear pro-
tective clothing (disposable coveralls, rubber-coated or
nonlatex gloves) and take care when handling tools,
clothing, and gear that could be contaminated.

FIRST AID 73
.Other First-Aid Cases
The sap of these plants must be on your skin for 10 to 20
minutes before it starts to cause problems. So, if you think you
have touched a poisonous plant, immediately stop to wash the
exposed area well with soap and water. Wipe with rubbing
alcohol and apply calamine or other soothing skin treatment.
If the reaction is severe, if the genital area is affected, if
plant parts were chewed or swallowed, or if contaminated
smoke was inhaled, seek immediate medical attention.
The sap also binds well to clothing, so change clothes.
Keep the outfit you were wearing separate from your other
clothing, and wash it separately back home.
Abdominal Pain
There are many causes of abdominal pain. It might be as harm-
less as an upset stomach or as dangerous as appendicitis.
Always take all complaints of abdominal pain seriously. Watch
the person closely for increasing pain or changes in the level of
consciousness. Most people who have appendicitis will have the
same symptoms. First there is a loss of appetite. Then a pain
begins in the lower right quarter of the abdomen and gets
worse over several hours. Finally, there is nausea and vomiting.
If you think someone might have appendicitis, do not
allow the person to eat or drink. Call 911 or a physician imme-
diately. Also seek medical attention if someone suffering
abdominal pain has a temperature of 102 degrees or higher
or if there are signals of blood in the urine, vomit, or stool.

Dental Injuries
A blow to the face can knock out a tooth or break
a jaw. These dental injuries require immediate medical
treatment. However, an infected tooth with pain, fever, or
swelling can be just as serious and also requires treatment with-
out delay.
Braces and retainers. If a wire is causing irritation, cover the
end of the wire with a small cotton ball, beeswax, cold candle
wax, or a piece of gauze until you can get the person to the
dentist. If a wire is embedded in the cheek, tongue, or gum
tissue, do not attempt to remove it. See a dentist or
orthodontist immediately.
Bitten lip or tongue. Apply direct pressure to the bleeding area
with a clean cloth. If swelling is present, apply a cold, wet cloth
or pad. If the bleeding does not stop, the injured person should
seek medical attention.
Toothache. Have the victim rinse the mouth vigorously with
warm water (to clean out debris); use dental floss to remove
any food that might be trapped between the teeth. If swelling is
present, place a cold, wet cloth or pad on the outside of the
cheek. Have the person see a dentist immediately—toothache
may be a signal that infection is present.
Broken, chipped, or loosened tooth. Gently rinse the mouth
with warm water. Place a cold, wet cloth or pad in the area
of the injury, to minimize swelling. The victim should see a
dentist immediately; take the broken or chipped piece of
tooth along.
Knocked-out tooth. Pick up the tooth carefully by the crown
(not the root). Rinse the tooth gently under cold running water
or with milk, if it is available. Do not scrub, scrape, or dry the
tooth, and do not allow the tooth to dry. Flush the empty tooth
socket with clean water or saline solution. Apply pressure with
a clean cloth or gauze to stop any bleeding. If within the first
20 minutes of being knocked out, place the tooth back into the
empty tooth socket and press firmly. Have the victim bite their
teeth together and go directly to the dentist’s office or emer-
gency room. If it has been more than 20 minutes, place the
tooth in a container of milk or cool water. Take the victim and
the tooth and go directly to the dentist’s office or emergency
room, ideally within 30 minutes.

into position. The wrap must be easily removable in case the
person starts to vomit. Monitor the airway. If swelling is pres-
ent, apply cold, wet cloths or pads. Call a dentist or take the
victim immediately to the emergency room.
Avoiding Dental Emergencies
Proper dental care and maintenance will prevent many
dental injuries. To reduce the chance of tooth injury,
follow these tips.
• Always use your safety belt when riding in
an automobile.
• Wear the proper safety gear, including a mouth
guard, when playing contact sports.
• Never bite down on hard items such as popcorn
kernels, ice, or nutshells.
• Do not use your teeth to open packages or bottles.


76 FIRST AID
Bites and Stings
The bites of mosquitoes, chiggers, and no-see-
ums are irritating but not usually dangerous.
More troublesome are ticks, some spiders,
and some ants. To avoid getting bitten by
ticks, wear long pants and a long-sleeved
shirt whenever you are in tick-infested
woodlands and fields. Button your collar
and tuck your pant cuffs into your boots or
socks. Inspect yourself daily, especially the
hairy parts of your body, and immediately
remove any ticks you find.
Ticks bury their heads beneath the skin of
their victims. To remove a tick, with gloved hands,
grasp it with tweezers close to the skin and gently pull
until it comes loose. Don’t squeeze, twist, or jerk the
tick, as doing so could leave its mouthparts still
buried in the skin. The small tweezers in many first-
aid kits have a tear-drop shaped hole in one of the
arms. This is for removing ticks. Wash the wound
with soap and water and apply an antiseptic.
Thoroughly wash your hands after handling a tick.
Because some ticks carry diseases, you should seek
medical care if you get sick or develop a rash after being
bitten by a tick.
There are two kinds of black widow
spiders. The southern black widow is
shiny with an hourglass-shaped red
spot on the abdomen. The northern
black widow spider has a row of
red spots on the abdomen as
well as two crosswise red
bars on the underside of the
abdomen. Sometimes these
markings are yellow or
white, and the spider
might have red or brown
legs. The bite of the
northern black widow is
slightly less toxic than the
southern spider. These spiders like
to dwell under stones and logs, in long grass, brush piles,
When removing a tick,
do not burn the tick,
prick it with a pin, or
cover it with petroleum
jelly or nail polish. Doing
so may cause the tick
to release more of the
disease-carrying bacteria.

barns, garages, latrines, and other shadowy spots. Its bite
can cause redness and sharp pain, sweating, nausea and
vomiting, stomach pain and cramps, and severe muscle
pain and spasms. Breathing might become difficult.
Wash the bitten area with soap and water and apply a cold
cloth. Anyone with more than trivial symptoms should go to the
hospital. Because a black widow bite can be fatal to small chil-
dren, they should be taken to the emergency room immediately.
The brown recluse is a medium-sized, yellow-tan to dark
brown spider with a violin-shaped mark on its back. These
spiders often hide in little-used storage areas such as cellars and
closets, and outdoors in protected areas under rocks and loose
tree bark. A victim might not notice the bite at first, but within
two to eight hours, there will be mild to severe pain with redness
at the bite site. The area becomes swollen and tender, and a
small blister usually forms, followed by an open sore. The victim
might suffer fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, and a faint
rash. Wash the bite site with soap and water, and apply a cold
pack to the area. Seek medical attention immediately.
The sting of a fire ant can be extremely painful. If
disturbed, fire ants will swarm and attack cooperatively and
aggressively, often grabbing hold of the victim’s skin and
stinging repeatedly. Be careful not to break the tiny blisters that
form from the stings. Wash the injured area well, using
antiseptic or soap and water. Cover with a sterile bandage and,
for relief, try a paste made of baking soda and water, and take a
mild nonaspirin pain reliever. The blistered area should heal
within a week.

Some people may be highly allergic to fire ant bites, which can cause the
life-threatening reaction called anaphylactic shock (anaphylaxis). For more
information, see “Life-Threatening Emergencies.”


78 FIRST AID
Other First-Aid Cases.
If you are stung by a bee but are not allergic to bee stings,
you can simply remove the stinger brushing it out with a flat-
surfaced object such as a thin stick. Don’t try to squeeze the
stinger out. Doing so will force more venom into the skin from
the sac attached to the stinger. For bee, wasp, or hornet stings,
use an ice pack to help reduce pain and swelling.
Common scorpion stings often cause severe, sharp pain
with swelling and discoloration, but generally cause no lasting
ill effects. An ice pack or cold compress should help relieve any
itching and pain. An over-the-counter antihistamine may help
relieve symptoms. However, if the victim has a history of aller-
gic reactions to insect stings or shows signals of illness, seek
medical help at once.
For information about anaphylactic shock (anaphylaxis),
a severe allergic reaction, see “Life-Threatening
Emergencies.” Without immediate treatment, a person
who goes into anaphylactic shock can die. People who
are allergic to bee or wasp stings, fire ant bites, or pea-
nuts, shellfish, and certain other foods can have similar
anaphylactic reactions. Small children may be especially vulnerable to a
severe reaction. It is important that anyone who knows they have severe
allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) carry an epinephrine injector with them at
all times.

Animal bites. The bite of a dog, cat, or any other warm-blooded
animal is a serious puncture wound. The animal might suffer
from rabies, a deadly illness that can be transmitted through the
saliva of some mammals, in particular dogs, skunks, raccoons,
foxes, and bats. The only way to learn if an animal is infected is
to catch it and have it tested by medical experts.
To treat an animal bite, scrub the area with soap and water
and, if possible, flush the wound with clean water for a full five
minutes to remove saliva. Control the bleeding and cover the
wound with a sterile bandage. The victim must see a doctor,
who can determine whether to give rabies
shots.
If the bite is that of a pet dog or cat,
get the name, address, and phone number
of the owner, if possible. If bitten by a
wild animal, do not try to capture it.
Instead, have someone make note of the
type of animal, its description, and the
direction in which it was headed,
then contact the local public health
authorities to report the bite.
An unprovoked attack could be a sign that an animal is
rabid. Report all animal bites to your local public health
authorities or the police. Do not kill the animal unless
necessary, and do not put yourself at risk by trying to
catch the animal. Call the police, rangers, or animal
control officers, who are trained to do the job safely.
Suspicious animals may be confined and observed, or
destroyed so that their brains can be tested for rabies.

Snakebites. The bite of a nonvenomous snake causes only
minor puncture wounds and can be treated as such. Since
snakes are not warm-blooded, they cannot carry rabies. Scrub
the bite with soap and water, treat with an antiseptic, and cover
with a sterile bandage. However, a venomous snakebite requires
special care.
The venomous snakes of North America are pit vipers and
coral snakes. Pit vipers, including rattlesnakes, copperheads,
and cottonmouths, have triangular-shaped heads with pits on
each side in front of their eyes. The signs and symptoms of a
pit viper bite include puncture marks, pain (perhaps extreme)
and swelling (possibly severe), skin discoloration, nausea and
vomiting, shallow breathing, blurred vision, and shock.
Coral snakes have black noses and are marked with red
and yellow bands side-by-side, separated by bands of black.
They inject a powerful venom that affects the victim’s nervous
system. The signs and symptoms of a coral snakebite include
slowed physical and mental reactions, sleepiness, nausea, short-
ness of breath, convulsions, shock, and coma.
The bite of a venomous snake can cause sharp, burning
pain. The area around the bite might swell and become discol-
ored; however, a venomous snake does not inject venom every
time it bites. Here are the steps for treating the bite of
venomous snakes.
Step 1—Get the victim under medical care as soon as possible
so that physicians can neutralize the venom.
Step 2—Remove rings and other jewelry that might cause
problems if the area around the bite swells.
Step 3—Wash the wound.
Step 4—Have the victim lie down and position the bitten part
lower than the level of the heart. Encourage the victim, who
may be frightened, to stay calm. Keep providing assurance that
he or she is being cared for.
Step 5—Treat for shock.
Do not make any cuts on or apply suction to the bite, do
not apply ice, do not apply a tourniquet, and do not use electric
shock such as from a car battery. These methods could cause
more harm to the victim or are not proven to be effective.
As a precaution,
use a hiking stick
to poke among
stones and brush
ahead of you

Concussions
A concussion is a brain injury caused by a blow to the head or
by a sudden change in motion of the head in which the brain
bounces rapidly back and forth inside the skull.
Someone does not need to be knocked out to have a
concussion.
Anyone who has had a concussion in the past is usually
more vulnerable for another concussion. This is especially true
if the person has not completely recovered from the earlier
concussion.
Recovery from a concussion can take days or even months.
It generally takes longer for children and adolescents to recover
from a concussion that it does for an adult.
Someone with a concussion might be disoriented, irritable,
confused or combative. Some of the symptoms of a concussion
are:
• Difficulty thinking clearly
• Difficulty concentrating
• Headache
• A blank stare or dazed look when you look into their eyes
• Behavior or personality changes
• Changes in balance
• Disorientation (for example, unable to say where they are or
what time it is)
• Delayed physical responses
• Slurred speech
• Nausea and vomiting
• Difficulty with simple mental tasks
• Sensitivity to bright light or loud noises
• Sleepiness
These symptoms might occur right away or take some time
to develop. A person with a suspected concussion should be
assessed repeatedly.
It is uncommon for someone to have all of these
symptoms. If someone has a history of getting hit in the head
and they show some of these signs, they most likely have had a
concussion.


.Other First-Aid Cases
Concussions and neck injuries often occur together.
Anyone with a concussion needs to be evaluated for a neck
injury; anyone with a neck injury needs to be evaluated for a
concussion.
The main treatment for a concussion is brain rest. This
includes no video games, no TV, and limited schoolwork.
Keep an eye on the person to make sure they don’t drop
into a coma.
Seek medical attention
Do not give they any medications, especially aspirin.
How to Splint a Finger
To splint a finger: First of all do not splint a finger in full
extension. Do not use a tongue suppressor as a support.
Step 1—The injured finger should be immobilized in a slightly
bent position. This can be done by taping the finger to a curved
aluminum finger splint. Cutting off a portion of a Structural
Aluminum Malleable (SAM®) splint and bending it to
shape is one way to do this.
Step 2—Taping the finger to an
adjacent finger helps provide
stability. If a finger splint is not
available consider having the
person grasp a baseball-sized
ball of material in the palm and
then wrap the entire hand.

conditions and be
prepared to take
quick action. The
procedures for
adults, children,
and infants may
differ slightly.
Life-Threatening
Emergencies
The right first aid given quickly can save a life. A person who
has stopped breathing must receive rescue breathing within
three to five minutes or brain damage will occur. People who
may need lifesaving first aid include victims of heart attacks,
deep cuts with severe bleeding, submersion emergency (or near-
drowning), and lightning strikes. After calling for help, assess
the situation to decide what you should do and in which order.
Is the person conscious? Check for signs of life. Tap the
person on the shoulder to see if he or she responds. Ask a ques-
tion such as, “Are you OK?” If there is no response to sound or
touch, the person is unconscious. If you are by yourself, call for
medical help. In most areas, this means dialing 911 to activate
your community emergency response system. If someone is
with you, have them call for medical help. If the victim is a
child or an infant and you are alone, give two minutes of care
before you leave to find medical help.
The order of treatment in a life-threatening emergency is:
call for medical help, automated external defibrillator, compres-
sions, airway, and breathing.
Automated External Defibrillator (AED)
After calling or sending for medical help, it’s critical that the next
step is to get an AED, if one is nearby and easily accessible. If
you are by yourself, go get it, attach and use the AED, and then
provide compressions. If someone is with you, one of you should
call for medical help and get the AED. The other person should
start with compressions. Here’s why this is so important:
The heart is made up of many muscle fibers that usually
contract and relax in unison to pump blood. During a heart
attack, those muscle fibers do not work together. A heart attack
can lead to what is known as “cardiac arrest.” Another cause of


86 FIRST AID
.Life-Threatening Emergencies.
cardiac arrest is an abnormal electrical heart rhythm, most com-
monly known as sudden cardiac arrest or ventricular fibrillation.
A machine called a defibrillator can send an electrical
shock through the heart to momentarily stop all electrical
activity. This pause gives the heart enough time to try to restore
an effective heartbeat (rhythm). A person whose heart has
stopped functioning can be treated with this special device, if
one is available. Ideally, this should happen within several
minutes of the victim’s collapse.
Most ambulances, hospitals, and emergency care facilities
are equipped with defibrillators for use by trained medical
personnel. Because a defibrillator must be used quickly
(within several minutes) to save a person’s life, a portable
defibrillator called an automated external defibrillator (AED)
was developed. Many first responders such as police officers
and firefighters carry and are trained in the use of AEDs.
An AED is computerized. It can check a person’s heart
rhythm and recognize a rhythm that requires a shock. It can
also advise the rescuer when a shock is needed. AEDs use
voice prompts, lights, and text messages to tell the rescuer the
steps to take.
AEDs are very accurate and easy to use. With training, a
layperson can learn how to operate an AED. AED training is
usually included with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
instruction. AED machines contain easy diagrams and provide
simple oral instructions. Turn the machine on, apply the pads to
the skin of the chest in the places shown on the drawing on the
pads, listen for the directions from the machine, and follow the
verbal instructions. Leave the pads in place. If a second shock
is needed the machine will tell you to stand back and push the
button again. No one should be touching the victim when the
shock is delivered.
Compressions
If there is no pulse and no breathing, attach and use an AED
if one is quickly available. Otherwise begin CPR chest
compressions immediately.
Many public places such as airports, churches, schools,
and malls now have AEDs in clearly marked, desig-
nated areas much the same way that fire extinguishers
are made readily available for access in an emergency.


FIRST AID 87
..Life-Threatening Emergencies
Accidents or medical conditions that cause a person to stop
breathing can also stop the heart. If the heart is not pumping
and circulating blood through the body, the victim will not be
breathing, moving, or making normal sounds. You should
perform CPR immediately.
Continue cycles of CPR (30 chest compressions and two
breaths). Do not stop CPR except in one of these situations:
• You find an obvious sign of life, such as breathing.
• An AED is ready to use.
• Another trained responder or EMT arrives to take over.
• You become too exhausted to continue.
• The scene becomes unsafe.
Learning CPR and how to use an AED requires careful
instruction from a certified teacher. Perhaps you can practice
CPR and AED use at Scout meetings. The American Red Cross,
American Heart Association, and Emergency Care and Safety
Institute offer classes, too. Your Scout leaders can help you find
training to learn this lifesaving skill.
While the techniques for CPR are different for adults, children, and infants,
the cycle of 30 chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths
applies to everyone. To receive full and proper CPR training, contact your
American Red Cross chapter, the American Heart Association, or the
Emergency Care and Safety Institute. See the resources section in the

Airway
The airway is the passage
that allows air entering
the mouth or nose to
reach the lungs. Always
protect the airway of any
accident victim. If the per-
son begins to vomit, turn
the victim onto his or her
side so that the vomit
comes out of the mouth
and is not aspirated
(inhaled) into the lungs.
If a victim is uncon-
scious, carefully place the person on his or her back, protecting
the head and neck if you must roll the person over. Then, if
there is no risk for head or spinal injury, open the airway by
pressing (or tilting) on the forehead with one hand and lifting
the chin with the other to tilt back the head. This action will
keep the tongue from blocking the person’s airway.
Breathing
After opening the victim’s airway, check to see if the person
can breathe normally. Place your cheek in front of the victim’s
mouth (about 1 to 2 inches away). Look, listen, and feel for
movement and breathing for no more than 10 seconds. If the
person is breathing effectively, you will feel and hear the air-
Look, listen, feel—these are the steps to check for breathing.
Tilt the head and
lift up on the chin
to open the airway
of an unconscious
person.
If opening the
airway restores
breathing, place
the victim in a
recovery position.
Continue to moni-
tor the person’s
breathing until
help arrives.

flow on your cheek and see and feel the chest rising
and falling at regular intervals. Your cheek might be
more sensitive to soft breaths if it is moistened. If
there is no breathing or movement from an adult,
immediately begin CPR. For an infant or child, give
two rescue breaths before beginning CPR.
Step 1—Place a CPR breathing barrier over the
victim’s mouth. That may protect both of you from
orally transmitted diseases.
Step 2—Give two rescue breaths. While maintain-
ing the head-tilt, pinch the nostrils, seal your mouth
over the victim’s mouth and blow into it to fill the
person’s lungs. (For an infant, seal your mouth over
both the mouth and nose, then breathe gently.)
Each breath should last about 1 second. Watch to
see if the chest clearly rises. Remove your mouth
and then give another rescue breath.
If the victim revives, put him or her in a recovery
position and treat for shock. Monitor the person to
make sure breathing does not stop again.
CPR Breathing Barriers
While the risk of getting a disease from giving rescue breaths is extremely
small, you should use a breathing barrier between your mouth and the
victim’s if one is available. This will protect you from contact with the vic-
tim’s bodily fluids and from breathing the air exhaled from the injured or
ill person. Place the breathing barrier over the victim’s mouth as directed
on the device.
If you have not been trained in CPR or are unable to perform rescue
breaths, then just perform compressions until an AED arrives or medical
personnel can take over care of the victim.
Rescue breathing techniques are constantly being improved. Check with
your Scout leaders and local American Red Cross chapter, American Heart
Association office, or the Emergency Care and Safety Institute for current
methods and training opportunities.

Heart Attack
A heart attack is a life-threatening condition that causes death
of or damage to the heart muscle. When an artery that supplies
blood to the heart is blocked, a heart attack can occur. Heart
attack requires quick action to possibly save a life. Learn to rec-
ognize the warning signs and symptoms of a heart attack, then
be prepared to take prompt action by calling 911 or the local
emergency-response number. Immediately administer CPR if
necessary.
Common Warning Signs of Heart Attack
Here are some common warning signs and symptoms of heart
attack.
• Persistent, uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or
pain in the center of the chest behind the breastbone. It may
last several minutes or longer and may come and go. It need
not be severe.
• Pain spreading to the shoulders, arms, neck, or jaw.
• Unusual sweating—for instance, perspiring even though a
room is cool.
• Nausea—stomach distress with an urge to vomit.
• Shortness of breath.
• A feeling of weakness.
Should anyone complain of these symptoms, call 911 to get
medical attention for the victim right away. Be aware that a com-
mon reaction of men and women who are experiencing signs
and symptoms of heart attack is to deny that anything is wrong.
Be ready to begin CPR if the heartbeat and breathing stop.
Women may
experience differ-
ent symptoms
than do men. A
woman might also
have intermittent
back, abdominal,
and upper-body
pain; unexplained
fatigue; and dizzi-
ness. She might
feel heaviness in
the chest or a
burning sensation
rather than pain.
If you suspect someone is having a heart attack and this person is con-
scious, try to find out the following.
• Is the person taking any type of blood-thinning medication?
• Is the person allergic to aspirin?
• Does this person have stomach problems?
• Has the person ever been advised by a physician not to take aspirin?
If the answer is “no” to all of the questions above, when you call 911,
emergency responders may advise you to offer the person two uncoated
baby aspirin tablets (81 mg apiece). Aspirin must be used, not painkillers
such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol).


FIRST AID 91

Stroke
A stroke, also called a brain attack, occurs when an artery to
the brain either bursts or is blocked by a clot. When blood sup-
ply to the brain is interrupted, brain cells begin to die.
Common Warning Signs of Stroke
This disease injures the brain, and the signs happen fast; the
victim might not be aware a stroke is occurring. Others nearby
might not know it, either. This is why it is so important to
know the common warning signs of stroke. Call for transport to
a hospital as soon as any of these signs appear.
• Sudden weakness or numbness of the face, arm, or leg
(especially on one side of the body)
• Sudden confusion or trouble speaking or understanding speech
• Sudden trouble seeing
• Sudden dizziness, with loss of balance or coordination and
trouble walking
• Sudden and severe headache with no known cause
Think FAST
Use this quick method to help determine whether
someone might have suffered a stroke.
F = Face. Ask the person to smile. Watch for weakness
on one side of the face, which will look like a droop-
ing mouth and cheek.
A = Arm. Ask the person to raise both arms. Watch for
weakness or numbness in the limbs. Does one arm
drift downward?
S = Speech. Ask the person to say a simple sentence
such as, “May I have a cookie?” Listen for slurred
speech.
T = Time. Time to call 911 right away if the person
cannot perform any one of the simple tasks above
or shows any other signs of stroke. Be sure to note
the time the signs began.
While waiting for
medical personnel
to arrive, keep
the person calm
and comfortable.
A stroke could
make a person
nervous and
afraid. Reassure
the person that
help is on the way.
Do not give the
victim anything to
eat or drink.

When Someone Is Choking
A person who is choking and can cough, speak,
or breathe is still getting some air to the lungs.
Encourage him or her to cough up the object, and
be ready to administer first aid if it is needed.
However, if the person is coughing weakly or
making high-pitched noises, or if the person can’t
cough, speak, or breathe, you will need to take
quick action. Ask the person if they are choking
and get consent to help them.
Have someone call for help, then do
the following.
Step 1—If the child or adult is conscious, give five
back blows as shown. From behind, place one arm
across the person’s chest and lean forward. Firmly
strike the person’s back with the heel of your hand.
Follow the five back blows with abdominal thrusts
as described in steps 2 and 3.
Step 2—Stand behind the victim. Put your arms
around the waist; make a fist and place the thumb
side against the body just above the navel. Cover
your fist with your other hand.
Step 3—Thrust your clasped hands inward and
upward with enough force to pop loose the
obstruction. Do this up to five times, if needed.
Step 4—Repeat steps 1 through 3 until the obstruc-
tion clears, medical help arrives, or the person
becomes unconscious.
Someone who is chok-
ing on food may grasp
the throat to signal that
he or she is unable to
breathe. Treat by per-
forming back blows and
abdominal thrusts.

..Life-Threatening Emergencies
Severe Bleeding
First aid for a large wound that is not severely bleeding requires
routine wound care. Wash the wound and apply a sterile dressing,
But a careless moment with a knife, an ax, or a power tool or any
number of other accidents can sever a large blood vessel in the
arm or leg, causing severe bleeding. Quick first-aid action can stop
bleeding and perhaps save a person from bleeding to death.
First Aid for Severe Bleeding
Step 1—Put on nonlatex disposable gloves and protective gog-
gles. Do not remove any large penetrating objects. With a clean
cloth or sterile dressing as a pad, use the palm of your hand to
apply firm pressure directly over the wound. If you have an
elastic bandage handy, use it to secure the pad tightly over the
source of the bleeding.
If a pressure pad has become soaked with blood, place a
fresh pad over the first one (do not remove it) and continue
applying pressure.
Step 2—After the bleeding stops, hold the pad in place with a
sterile bandage—an elastic wrap, strips torn from clean cloth-
ing, or something else similar close at hand. Bind the pad
firmly but not so tightly that circulation is cut off.
Step 3—If the bandage is on an arm or a leg, periodically
check for circulation (feeling, warmth, color). No circulation
is an indication that the bandage should be loosened.
Wounds can be incisions—clean cuts through the skin, such as
those caused by knives, razors, broken glass, or other sharp
objects, or lacerations—rough, jagged cuts. Deep wounds may
injure muscles, tendons, and nerves. Contamination of any
wound increases the chances of infection.
A paramedic or
physician will
probably want to
know when the
injured person
was immunized
against tetanus—
a serious illness
that can some-
times result when
bacteria are
introduced
through cuts,
abrasions, and
other breaks in
the skin.
Applying direct pressure on a wound will stop most bleeding.


94 FIRST AID
.Life-Threatening Emergencies.
TOURNIQUETS
If direct pressure does not stop the bleeding, it is likely that the
pressure is being applied to the wrong place. Reposition and
continue pressure. If this fails, consider using a tourniquet—a
device designed specifically to be tightened around the limb
between the wound and the heart—as a last resort for stopping
severe bleeding. This method is used only when all other efforts
have failed. Because a tourniquet completely stops the flow of
blood to the limb, the limb might die from lack of circulation
and need to be amputated. The likelihood of this is directly
related to the length of time the tourniquet is on the limb.
In the past, field tourniquets were made from a strip of
cloth at least two inches wide (never a cord, wire, rope, or any
other thin material). The strip was tied with an overhand knot
above the wound, and a stick, tent peg, or similar rod-shaped
object was placed on the knot and tied down with a square
knot. The stick was then twisted just until the bleeding
stopped, and then secured so the tourniquet would not come
loose. Today, a tourniquet generally is an inexpensive,
commercially-made device designed for this specific purpose.
Once a tourniquet has been applied, write a note as to the
location of the tourniquet and the time it was applied and
attach it to the victim’s clothing in an obvious location to let
medical personnel know a tourniquet is in place. Treat the
victim for shock and give first aid for other injuries. Once a
tourniquet has been applied it should not be removed.
Prolonged placement of a tourniquet can lead to
complications such as nerve paralysis and damage to or loss of
a limb. Studies have shown that these risks are less than those
seen when a tourniquet is released even for a short time.
For any case of severe bleeding, summon emergency
medical help immediately. Always use nonlatex, disposable
gloves and protective goggles when rendering aid.
Anaphylactic Shock (Anaphylaxis)
For most people, bee or wasp stings will cause pain, redness,
and a little swelling around the affected area and perhaps a few
days of itching. For the small number of people who are allergic
to bee or wasp venom or fire ant bites, these stings and bites
can cause a life-threatening reaction called anaphylactic shock
(anaphylaxis). Symptoms can include a swelling of throat tis-
sues or tongue that restricts air passages and makes breathing
difficult or even impossible. The epinephrine injector must be
If the injury is on
a flexible part of
the body—an
elbow or knee, for
example—after
the bleeding has
stopped, use a
splint to immobi-
lize the joint and
prevent the
wound from
pulling open.


..Life-Threatening Emergencies
with the person at all times. Having it back at camp does no
good when it is needed on the trail.
First Aid for Anaphylactic Shock
Step 1—Call 911 or your local emergency-response number.
Step 2—Check the victim for a medical ID bracelet, necklace,
or information card. Ask if the person is carrying a prescribed
emergency medical kit. You might be able to assist the person
under certain circumstances AND if you are trained and
allowed to assist by state or local regulations. If so, follow the
kit instructions exactly and assist the person by locating the
medication kit and handing it to him or her. It is best that the
individual administers the medication. If the person is uncon-
scious, follow the A-B-C lifesaving sequence and/or follow
instructions provided by emergency medical professionals.
Step 3—See that the victim receives follow-up medical treatment.
If you are not qualified to administer epinephrine, help
make sure the person stays in a comfortable position for breath-
ing while awaiting medical help. This will usually be a sitting
position. Many people will have a rebound of anaphylaxis after
the first injection. Be ready to assist with a second injection if
needed. Everyone who has used an injection for anaphylaxis
should be sent for professional medical care.
Without immediate treatment, a person who goes into
anaphylactic shock can die. People who are allergic to
peanuts, shellfish, and certain other foods can have ana-
phylactic reactions if they ingest or even inhale particles
of these foods. For instance, people who are allergic to
peanuts cannot consume foods cooked in peanut oil.
Any Scout who
has an allergy
that could cause
anaphylactic
shock should
share that
information with
Scout leaders and
always let group
leaders know
where the
anaphylaxis
medications are
carried so that
they can be made
available at a
moment’s notice.
Life-threatening food allergies are rare. However, an
increasing number of people suffer from food-allergy reac-
tions that, although not life-threatening, can cause great
discomfort. If you have a food allergy, always be sure to
let Scout leaders know about it. They can then work with
members of the patrol and troop to ensure that the foods
that trigger an allergic reaction are avoided during the
planning and carrying out of Scout events. Making a situa-
tion safe for everyone is also a way to increase the sense
of cooperation and support within a Scout unit.

Behavior
A leading cause of death for young people is suicide. And all too
often adolescents turn to violence as a way of acting out. Many
people who are considering such actions send out signals.
If you ever have the feeling—even just a “gut” feeling—that
someone might getting ready to cause harm to themselves or oth-
ers you must tell someone. The only mistake you can make is to
do nothing. Take a trusted adult into confidence.
Look and listen for these warning signs:
• The person says they are considering suicide, verbally or online
• A previous attempt
• Depression
• Changes in appearance, actions. and emotions
• Feeling of hopelessness
• They begin alienating friends
• They feel endangered
• Personal crisis like death of a parent, sibling or pet
• Newfound energy (suicide often follows a sudden surge of energy.)
If you suspect someone is considering suicide, in addition to
telling a trusted adult, you should be there for the person. Listen
carefully without judging, and stay connected. Ask whether they
are considering suicide; it will not increase the risk they will do so.
Several factors that someone is likely to be a danger to others:
• They are or have been bullied
• Change in behavior
• Withdrawal from school or other activities
• A feeling of isolation
• A preoccupation with violence
• Revenge seeking
• Known access to weapons
• They are increasingly impulsive
If you notice several of these risk factors, discuss them with
a trusted adult. If a specific target has been mentioned, provide
that information.
The national suicide hotline is 988.
It is available any time, day or night.
