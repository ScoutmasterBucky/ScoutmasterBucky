.Introduction
Introduction
Plumbing, including pipe fitting, is an important and well-paid
occupation. The industry is quite broad. It covers installations
and repairs in homes, commercial properties, and factories.
Plumbing pipelines are used for water supply, waste drainage,
natural-gas heating, and many other purposes.
As a Scout, your major interest in plumbing probably will
be in the field of home repairs. If a faucet leaks, a pipe freezes,
or a plumbing fixture does not operate properly, you will want
to know how to evaluate the problem. Then you will be able to
decide on the proper steps to take to fix the problem—or deter-
mine that the job requires a professional plumber.
As you try out the projects and fulfill requirements for
the Plumbing merit badge, you will develop many practical
skills. Even if you do not make plumbing your vocation, this
experience will help you gain knowledge that will always
be useful.
When you discover a plumbing problem, you can
often take care of basic plumbing needs, but remember
that a plumber is like a doctor. For serious trouble or
problems beyond your ability, you should get help
from a trained specialist.

The Plumbing System of a House.
The Plumbing System
of a House
The plumbing system of a house relies on two basic things:
pressure and gravity. When you turn on a faucet, you can feel
the water pressure, weak or strong. The pressure comes from
a pump (if the water comes from a well) or from gravity (if the
water comes from a water tower or reservoir). When you flush
a toilet or pull the plug from a bathtub, gravity pulls the waste
and water down and away from the house.
A home’s plumbing can be divided into two main systems:
the supply system and the drainage system.
The Supply System
The supply system brings clean water into a home. The water
may come from a private well or from a municipal (city)
source. If you get your water from a municipal source, a large
pipe called a water main runs near your house. Between the
main and your home is a water meter, which keeps track of
the amount of water you use. If you use a private well, you do
not have a meter.
Close to the meter are one
or two shutoff valves you can use
to stop the water to your home.
If there are two valves to choose
from, use the one that supplies
the water to your meter instead
of the one between the meter and
your house. This practice will
help keep the meter from being
damaged by water pressure.

.The Plumbing System of a House
It is important to
know how to shut off the
water supply to your home
in case of an emergency.
Because supply water is
always under pressure, if a
leak or break occurs, water
will flow out of the pipe or
broken appliance. For this
reason, it is important to
shut off the water supply so
flooding does not occur.
Keep in mind that there are lots of smaller shutoff valves
throughout your home. If one of your water pipes breaks, or if
the smaller shutoff valves do not work properly, you will need
to use the main shutoff valve.
The water enters your house through the service pipe.
Inside your house, the service pipe branches off to supply
cold water to fixtures and appliances, including the hot-water
heater. From the hot-water heater, pipes branch off to supply
hot water to the places it is needed, such as sinks, bathtubs,
and washing machines.
Two kinds of water meters are “dial” and “direct.” To read the meters,
all you have to do is a little subtraction. If you have a dial meter, write
down the positions of the pointers. After a few days, write down the
new positions. Subtract the first reading from the second to determine
how much water was used in gallons or cubic feet. If you have a direct
meter, simply write down the number, wait a few days, and then
subtract it from the new number.
Another place to stop the main water supply to
your house is at a valve box. If you have one, it will
be under a round metal cover in the ground. You
may need a long-handled “key” to turn the valve,
or you may be able to turn it by hand.

Water for household use can be heated by a number of
means: an automatic gas heater, an automatic electric heater,
an oil- or gas-fired boiler that takes advantage of the furnace
burner, or a solar heater that uses solar collectors on the roof.
In general, gas or
electric water heaters and
boiler systems work this
way. When the water
temperature falls below
the temperature set on
the thermostat, the heater
automatically turns on.
It runs until the desired
water temperature is
reached and then shuts
off. A pipe at the top of
the hot-water heater
distributes the heated
water through the hot-
water pipes in a home.

Turning the water supply off and on some-
times makes pipes vibrate and “knock.” This
happens because there are air pockets in the
pipes. In older pipes, mineral deposits can
be knocked loose, causing faucet aerators
to clog. Fortunately, aerators are easy to
clear. Take apart the aerator, soak the parts
in vinegar, and then brush them with an old
toothbrush. Put the aerator back together,
making sure the washer is in good shape
and makes a tight seal.

plate, which prevent heated air and
flammable vapors from re-entering
the room once they have entered
the heater’s combustion chamber.

The Plumbing System of a House.
A solar system uses a storage tank.
A pressure pump pushes water through the
rooftop solar collectors to the storage tank
until the water is heated. Usually a gas or
electric water heater is used as a backup for
cloudy days.
Water expands when it is heated. If it
gets hot enough, it will form steam. The exact
temperature at which water turns to steam
depends upon the pressure. All hot-water
heating systems have temperature and
pressure-relief valves that allow for this
expansion and the escape of steam. A prop-
erly working valve will prevent explosions.
At least once each year, a knowledge-
able adult should shut off the power and
water and drain the hot-water heater to
remove sediment that collects in the bottom
of the tank. Such sediment can prevent your
relief valves and thermostats from working
correctly. If the relief valve leaks or overflows,
call a plumber to fix it. Do not simply plug
it. You need that valve to protect your
home from fire and explosions.
The Drainage System
The drainage system uses gravity to carry waste and water
away from your home. Drainpipes run vertically or slope
downward. They are larger in diameter than supply pipes and
have gentle bends so that waste can move freely. The drainage
system includes cleanouts and traps—places that clogs can be
cleared, usually with a “snake,” or an auger.
Your home’s “drainage stack” is vertical and usually 3 or
4 inches in diameter. Toilets must drain into a minimum 3-inch-
wide drainage stack, building drain, or branch drain. Sinks and
bathtubs may use branch pipes that slant downward into the
drainage stack at no less than 1/4" per foot (see the illustration
shown). The drainage stack connects to the main house drain,
which usually is just beneath the basement floor or in the crawl
space under your house. It runs at a downward slope to the
septic system or to a sewer main (a city pipe that carries waste
and water to a treatment plant).

Vents
Plumbing systems must have air vents to allow the free
passage of waste from fixtures. The air vents are an important
part of waste disposal, which is why the drainage system is
often called the drain-waste-vent (DWV) system. The drain and
vent pipes are tied together, or share pipes, and use the same
types of pipe.
As you can see in the illustration showing the drainage
and supply system, the main vent is an extension of the soil
pipe. Without air vents, the plumbing system would become
air-bound, like a small-necked bottle filled with water and then

turned upside down. The water
would run out of the bottle very
noisily, and it would take the bottle
a long time to empty. However, if a
hole the size of the bottleneck were
made in the bottom of the bottle,
the water would readily escape
when the bottle was tipped. For
the same reasons, it is necessary
to vent the plumbing at the proper
places and with the proper size
of pipe.
Vent pipes allow fresh air
to pass freely throughout the
plumbing system and to prevent
loss of water from traps due to
siphoning (suction caused by a
volume of water that has just
passed through or near the trap).
Traps
Under every plumbing fixture, there is a bent piece of pipe or
special fitting that is known as a trap. (A toilet has a built-in
trap.) Traps come in the shape of a drum (in older installations),
or a J, S, or P. Water rests in the trap and is called a water seal.
The water seal permits liquids and solids, but not air, to pass
through the pipe. As a result, any drain air or sewer gas that
might gather in the drainage system cannot make its way into
your home. Every time water travels down the drain, new water
replaces it in the trap, forming another seal.
If the water in a trap escapes, toxic and explosive sewer
gas can enter the building. Therefore, builders and plumbers
take every possible precaution to construct and connect traps so
that there is little chance of losing the water seal.

Vents also allow sewer gas to pass out safely above

Know Your Plumbing System
It is important to know the exact location of the main house
drain and the main cleanout. It is important also to find out
exactly where the drain runs. In addition, you should know the
location of the water main, the water meter, and all valves or
shutoffs. Each valve should have a tag attached to it, clearly
stating what fixture that particular pipe supplies.

When possible, you should study installations under construction or

blueprints showing the system being installed and will explain it to you.


16 PLUMBING
The Plumbing System of a House.
Freezing
The greatest danger to a plumbing system is freezing. Water
expands when it freezes, and it can cause house pipes to burst.
Repairing and replacing plumbing and water-damaged property
can cost thousands of dollars.
In climates where it freezes in the winter, every outdoor
tap that does not have a freeze-proof hydrant should be drained
in the fall. Most of these taps have a waste valve inside the
house or basement that can be shut off and then drained by
loosening a small cap that projects from the valve. The tap
should be opened to let air in as the pipe is drained. It should
be left open for winter.
If you know the weather will be very cold on a certain
day or night, you can take steps to help keep your pipes from
freezing. Open a few faucets to let water slowly drip out.
Moving water does not freeze as easily as still water. Also,
open cabinet doors to let the warm air of your home reach
the pipes under sinks. In very cold areas, use freeze-protection
tape and pipe insulation that can be bought at the local hard-
ware or home improvement store.
If you have a power outage, your home and its pipes may
drop below freezing temperatures. When the power comes back
on, you can turn up the house heat and wait for the pipes to
thaw. Frozen water in a pipe will sometimes thaw, and the
pipe will be fine. Other times, a crack
will have developed.
You will know a pipe has frozen if
your water does not flow. If the hot water
runs, but not the cold, you will know it
is the cold-water pipe that has the frozen
place. By the same token, if the hot water
will not flow, you will know that the hot-
water pipe has frozen.
Never leave a
hose connected
to an outdoor
tap during
winter months.
In cold climates, pipes often are insulated or wrapped with pipe
jacketing or electrical heat tape for added protection. Insulation of
certain walls and ceilings also can help protect pipes.
Never use any kind of open
flame to thaw a pipe—a
house fire could result.
The high heat can travel
down the pipe and ignite
materials such as the wood
and plaster inside the wall.
The materials may smolder
for a while and then burst
into flame many hours later.


PLUMBING 17
.The Plumbing System of a House
How to Safely Thaw a Pipe
If you need to thaw a pipe by hand, do it the safe way. First,
turn off the water to the frozen pipe by using the appropriate
shutoff valves. Second, open the faucet that the frozen pipe
supplies so that the steam that will form when you heat the
pipe can escape. Steam pressure can burst a pipe.
You can use a hair dryer to thaw the pipe. When using
a hair dryer, do not get the pipe so hot that you cannot touch
it. Keep the hair dryer moving. A cookie sheet between the
wall and the pipe will help protect the flammable materials
of the wall.
Another way to thaw a pipe is to wrap and tape a towel
to the affected part, and then pour hot water onto the towel.
Be prepared to deal with the hot water that will drip off the
towel, however.
After you have thawed a pipe, check it visually for cracks
and leaks.
How to Winterize Plumbing
In summer cottages or in homes where the family will be away
for a long winter trip during which the heat will be off, all
pipes and the water heater must be thoroughly drained. Also,
all traps must be treated to prevent freezing and damage. To
winterize a house, follow these steps.
Step 1—An adult should turn off the power
(electric or gas) to the water heater and then drain it.
Step 2—Shut off the main water valve, then open the
drain valve at the lowest point in the water system.
Step 3—Open all faucets to allow air to enter
the pipes from above. In addition, all drain
valves should be drained so that no water
remains in them.
Step 4—Detach the flexible hoses on
dishwashers and washing machines.
Step 5—If the house has a pumping system,
carefully drain the pressure tank and the pump
itself. Turn the pump a few times to make sure
the water is out of all its parts. If water piping is
installed in such a way that the water will not
drain out, then air must be blown into the pipes from an air
compressor to push the water from areas where it might collect.

In addition to the above steps, treat all the traps in the
house so that they will not freeze. It would be risky to empty
the traps completely (this would let sewer gas into the house).
The best thing to do is put a solution of antifreeze made
especially for RVs (recreational vehicles) mixed with water
into each of the smaller traps and into the toilet bowl and with
full-strength RV antifreeze in the main house trap. Be sure to
follow the instructions on the antifreeze container, and to use
RV antifreeze only with your parent or guardian’s permission
and under the direct supervision of a responsible adult. The
toilet tank should be flushed empty before the antifreeze is
added to the water in the bowl. Never pour antifreeze into
appliances such as dishwashers or in any water-supply pipes.
Use the RV antifreeze only in the drainpipes and their traps.

.Health and Safety Issues
Health and Safety Issues
Plumbing systems carry water into and out of a home through
a system of pipes. For the health and safety of the people who
live there, the water entering the home through the water-supply
system must be pure and clean.
Wastewater and sewage being carried away from the home
by way of the drainage system may contain bacteria, viruses,
and fungi that can cause serious diseases and set off allergies.
Wastewater should never come into contact with the water that
the family uses for drinking, bathing, or washing clothes and
dishes. This is the main reason that it is essential that your
family’s plumbing system be properly installed and regularly
checked to make sure it is in good working order.
National and Local Plumbing Regulations
Plumbing regulations have been developed to help make sure
that plumbing is installed and maintained correctly. These
regulations, commonly called plumbing codes, are important in
preventing the water-supply system from becoming contami-
nated and for preventing the spread of disease. National plumb-
ing codes exist that give specific regulations for all plumbing
operations. Many communities have adopted these regulations
or amended them to fit their local needs. These regulations are
for everyone’s protection.
Plumbing regulations vary according to location. For
example, regulations for areas with hard water, which causes
mineral deposits to build up on copper pipes, may not allow
copper pipes. Regulations for areas that get lots of snow and
ice may call for taller vent pipes on the roof.
The offices of your local health department, building
commission, and planning and zoning department will have
a copy of local plumbing regulations. Their phone numbers
are listed in the government (blue) section of your phone book.
You also can find a copy of local regulations or of national
regulations at your library. Ask a reference librarian for help.

Repair Precautions
Do-it-yourself repairs are simple and low-cost, unless you forget
the basic rules of plumbing repair: Turn off the water supply
before you start, and call a professional for anything other
than the most basic plumbing problems.
Here are some guidelines that will help you make
repairs safely.
• Protect the area where you are working before you start,
because you probably will spill some water.
• Protect chrome finishes with a cloth pad while you work.
• Wear protective gloves and goggles to avoid injury to the skin
and eyes when using chemical drain cleaners to unclog a drain.
• Keep power tools away from areas where water has leaked to
avoid shock hazards.
• Try to contain spilled water with towels or a wet-dry
vacuum cleaner.


PLUMBING 21
.Health and Safety Issues
Health and Safety Tips
• Properly maintain your hot-water heater. A hot-water
heater that is not functioning properly can cause
serious injury or even death. Modern water heaters
are controlled by a thermostat and must have properly working
pressure- and temperature-relief valves that prevent overheating,
fires, and explosions. It is dangerous to plug a hot-water heater’s
relief valve. If the valve leaks or needs to be replaced, call a plumber.
• If a clogged toilet
contains raw sewage,
or if the sewage has
overflowed onto the
floor, wear protective
gloves and goggles
during cleanup to
avoid contaminating
yourself or others.
Make sure to sanitize
the area afterward with
bleach or disinfectant.
• Keep flammable
materials away from the
hot-water heater. Never store flammable materials in the same area.
• Repair all leaks immediately. Otherwise mold or other growths may
contaminate the entire household.

Plumber’s Tools and Their Uses.
Plumber’s Tools
and Their Uses
Many of the tools used in plumbing will be found in your
family tool chest. As a Scout, you will, of course, handle tools
carefully, especially borrowed ones. Keep them clean and free
from rust. Have a place for each tool and keep it there. Your
care will pay off in better workmanship and the satisfaction
that goes with it.
Your merit badge counselor may be able to get permission
for you to use plumber’s tools in a trade school classroom or
in a plumbing contractor’s pipe shop. A neighborhood plumber
may be willing to let you use a workbench, vise, and tools and
advise you on their use.
Commonly Used Tools
Below are descriptions of the most commonly used
plumber’s tools and explanations about how to use
them properly.
Wrenches
• The pipe wrench is cleverly designed to grip and turn a pipe.
Its teeth bite into the pipe and hold it firmly. The wrench can
turn the pipe in only one direction at a time. To turn a pipe
in the opposite direction, you must remove the wrench and
turn it around.
• A chain wrench is good for fairly heavy work. It can grip pipes
in hard-to-reach places, and it has considerable leverage.
• An adjustable wrench works well to tighten and loosen the
nuts on faucets and other fixtures.
• A basin wrench can be used to tighten hard-to-reach nuts
behind sinks.
• A strap wrench is good for chrome and for plastic pipes
because it will not mar their surfaces.

.Plumber’s Tools and Their Uses
Augers
• A plumber’s auger, or “snake,” is
a flexible ribbon or coil of spring
steel that can be used to clean
out plugged drains.
• A hand-crank drain auger is
good for clearing out clogged
sinks and traps.
• A closet auger is made to
clear toilets.
• A commercial auger is a power-
driven device for cleaning out
a badly clogged drainage stack.
The device has a rotating blade
that can travel along inside the
pipe, chewing its way through the
material causing the trouble, including tree roots that have
grown into the joints of the house sewer.
Other Tools of the Trade
• Needle-nose pliers can be used to remove O-rings and clips
of faucets.
• Tongue-and-groove pliers can be adjusted to grip many
different sizes of pipe.
• A plunger (sometimes called a
“rubber force cup”) is a large
rubber suction cup attached to
a wooden handle. This tool can
clear drain stoppages, particularly
those in toilet drains.
• A level helps plumbers make sure
that the components of the
drainage system are
properly sloped downhill.
• A pipe cutter cuts gradually as it
is turned around the pipe. When
using a pipe cutter instead of a
hacksaw, you will more easily
make a straight—not slanted—cut. A pipe cutter also makes
it easier to avoid bending or crushing a copper pipe.

Plumber’s Tools and Their Uses.
Pipe vise
• A pipe vise, bolted to the workbench or tripod, is used to
hold steel pipe for cutting, reaming, and threading.
• Dies for threading pipe come in standard sizes. They are held
and adjusted in the diestocks, the long handles of which give
plenty of leverage for cutting threads. A guide, or follower, is
used when cutting threads to guide the stocks straight onto
the pipe. The die, diestock, and guide can be combined in
one handy tool.
A plunger should never be used to postpone a
needed cleanout, and it does not work well to open
vented pipes; it merely pushes the water up the
vent. It may even force the stoppage into the vent,
plugging it.

Soldering Tools and Materials
Plumbers use a metal filler called solder, which can be melted
to join two pieces of metal. Solder is an alloy, or blend, of tin
and other metals that melts at a lower temperature than the
pieces of metal being joined. Different proportions of metals
are used to give the solder the qualities needed for the kinds
of jobs to be done.
Pipe must be absolutely clean (use sand cloth or emery
paper) to hold a tight solder connection. Flux is a substance
used to remove any oily film or dust that might keep the solder
from uniting with the metal. Flux also removes oxides (thin
layers of rust or tarnish) and prevents further oxidation while
the metal is heated to the soldering temperature.
Use only lead-free solder. Although lead-tin solder is still available,
it contains lead and releases poisonous fumes. Over time, inhaling
these fumes can cause brain damage, and the lead from the joint
could leach into the home’s water supply.

26 PLUMBING
Plumber’s Tools and Their Uses.
A portable gas torch is a plumber’s main tool for soldering.
It heats pipe quickly to temperatures high enough for solder to
unite with pipe metal. You must use a fireproof guard shield
when you are working near flammable material, such as a wall
or house framing. You will need a spark lighter to light the gas
unless you have a self-igniting torch.
Be careful not to get any flux or hot solder on your
skin—it will burn you. A noncorrosive flux should
be used on plumbing.
When using a gas torch,
do so only under the close
supervision of a responsible
adult. Closely follow the
manufacturer’s instructions.

.Pipes and Fittings
Pipes and Fittings
Pipes and fittings are made of many different materials. Homes
built before the 1950s were built with cast-iron and galvanized-
steel pipes. Newer homes use copper and plastic pipes.
Kinds of Pipes
Some types of pipe are no longer used. For instance, a kind
of plastic pipe called PVC used to be installed for hot- and
cold-water supply, but the hot water made the pipe lose
its strength and the joints leak. For this reason, PVC pipe is
no longer recommended for use in the indoor water sys-
tem. Another outdated product is the galvanized steel pipe.
Galvanized-steel pipes are strong at first, but corrode and
leak after about 50 years. These days, steel pipes are used
mostly for gas installation, not for water.
Kinds of Fittings
Plumbing and gas pipes are joined together with fittings.
Fittings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials to
suit different plumbing needs.
• Elbows are used to change the direction a supply pipe
is going. An “el,” as it is also called, usually will have a
45- or 90-degree angle.
• Bends are the DWV system’s version of elbows. Their
angles are gradual so that solid waste can move through
them without getting stuck.
• Fittings called tees look like the letter T. They are used
to join two pipes that intersect at a right angle. If the
pipes that intersect are not the same diameter, you can
use a reducing tee.
You can join pipes
made of different
materials if you
follow your local
code and use the
proper fittings.

DWV fittings are referred to as sanitary branches and are
used where two or more drains intersect.
• Couplings connect pipes in a straight line, or run. Reducing
couplings are used between pipes of different diameters.
• Unions are needed because all pipes have right-hand
threads, and at some point you will need to disconnect
the line without having to cut it.
• Nipples are short pieces of pipe with threads on both ends.
They are used to join fittings.
• Transition fittings are used to join different kinds of pipe,
such as plastic to copper. (Transitions should not be used
to join two kinds of plastics.)
• Dielectric fittings are used when joining steel to copper. The
special plastic spacer in a dielectric fitting keeps the metals
apart. (Steel and copper corrode if they touch.) However, the
plastic piece also causes an interruption in the “grounding”
of a pipe. If a live electrical wire touches the metal pipe, the
pipe will be dangerous to touch.
• Caps are used at the end of a pipe to close it. Plugs are types
of caps used on a threaded fitting such as a cleanout hole.
Fastening steel
to copper without
a dielectric fitting
is like dipping
something in
acid—the metals
get eaten up. This
is why a plastic
fitting is used
to “connect”
these two types
of pipes.

Working With Pipe
Before you try out the projects for requirements 6 and 7,
examine the various kinds of pipe and understand how to cut
them to proper lengths, thread them, and fit them together.
Pipe Measurements
Length
Straight pipe length measurements are always given from end
to end. When a fitting is used on one end of the pipe, the
measurement reads from the end of the pipe to the center of
the fitting. If a fitting is used on each end, the measurement
reads from the center of one fitting to the center of the
opposite fitting.
Diameter
Most pipes are known by their inside diameter (ID). If you can
access the inside of a pipe, you can measure this yourself. You
may have to round your number to the nearest 1/8" to get the
nominal size, which is the size used to name it at the hardware
or plumbing store. For instance, supply pipes usually are 1/2",
The only
constant in pipe
measurement is

3/4", or 1" nominal size, although the exact
inside diameter may be slightly more or less.
If you cannot measure the inside of the
pipe, you can wrap a measuring tape around
the outside to determine its outside circumfer-
ence. Write down that measurement and note
the pipe material. The chart shown on the
next page will help you determine how outside
diameter measurements correspond to inside
diameter measurements.
Pipe fittings usually have the size stamped
on the outside. When you order a reducing
pipe fitting, which joins two different sizes of
pipe together, name the larger part of the fitting first.

.Working With Pipe
Threading Steel Pipes
To complete requirement 6, you will need to
cut, thread, and connect two steel pipes. Your
pipe should be about 2 feet long, although
you can use a piece a foot or more long. Dies
and diestocks can be rented.
Because you will always have to measure
any pipe you are going to cut, you should use
a tape measure or ruler and mark the exact
middle of your pipe with a dark pencil or
crayon. Now, put the pipe in the vise, with
the cutting mark extending far enough from
the vise so that the cutter or threader will not
be cramped or strike the bench while turning.
Complete requirement 6 by following the
illustrations and descriptions in this section.
Step 1—Cutting steel pipe. Tighten the
cutter on the pipe as shown, with the small
cutting wheel directly on your pencil or crayon
mark. Now push the cutter around the pipe,
gradually tightening the handle clockwise. As
you finish the cut, turn slowly in order to leave
a smooth edge.
Step 2—Reaming. Use the reamer and remove the
burrs left in the end of the pipe. Burrs are sharp, so
be careful not to cut your hands.
Step 3—Threading.
Apply the threader to
the end of the pipe with
enough pressure for the
chasers (cutting edges)
to take hold. Turn gently
until you are sure you
have a good clean start.
(If you do not get the die
squarely on the pipe, the threads
will not work in a fitting.) Oil
frequently with cutting oil to
reduce friction, checking the chart
shown here for the number of
threads required.
Materials
■■ Pipe vise
■■ Threading stock
(unthreaded steel pipe)
■■ Dies to fit your pipe (3/4"
or 1" pipe would be best)
■■ Steel coupling of the
proper size
■■ Pipe wrench
■■ Pipe cutter
■■ Reamer powered by a
brace or drill
■■ Small can of cutting oil
■■ Pipe compound (pipe
dope) or Teflon pipe tape

Step 4—Checking the set
of threads. This is how
your threads should look
when finished.
Step 5—Applying pipe
compound or pipe tape.
Put pipe compound on the threads you have
cut if your pipe is for gas lines. Wrap pipe tape
clockwise on the threads if your pipe is for water
lines. Compound or tape will ensure a joint that
is leakproof.
Step 6—Installing a coupling. Install your
coupling, tightening it firmly with the pipe wrench.
Now repeat the steps with the second piece of pipe
and tighten it into the other side of the coupling.
Plumbers have a formula they follow in threading
pipe of different sizes to ensure maximum strength
of joints. They also follow a formula in screwing
steel pipe into fittings. By using the same standards,
they know how to cut and thread pipe quickly
when making repairs, without having to measure
each set of threads. Below is a chart showing the
principal fittings for steel pipe.

.Soldering Copper Pipe
Soldering Copper Pipe
Nearly all houses built today contain copper plumbing. Copper
does not rust, and it will last the lifetime of the building in
which it is used. Rigid copper pipe and flexible copper tub-
ing are simple to install and can be fitted into corners where
wrenches cannot be used.
Rigid copper pipe with soldered fittings makes a more
permanent installation. This pipe comes in 10' and 20' sections
and is easily cut to the length required. Many sizes of rigid
copper pipe are available, but the most common for household
use are 1/2", 3/4", and 1" diameter. Since rigid copper pipe is
relatively soft, it is easy to cut with an inexpensive tube cutter.
Safety Rules
When working with metal, flux, and high temperatures
(gas torches), you should be aware of possible dangers.
The following rules will help keep your plumbing
activities safe and enjoyable.
• Always work with adult supervision.
• Always wear safety goggles or safety glasses, a shop apron, and,
when necessary, protective gloves.
• Protect your skin from flux. It is corrosive and may burn your skin.
• Avoid touching metal where it has just been cut. The burrs are sharp.
Sweep up burrs with a brush, not your hands.
• Treat every cut immediately, no matter how minor.
• The pipe and fittings are hot and should be handled carefully.
• Avoid soldering near flammable materials.
• Keep a fire extinguisher handy.


36 PLUMBING
Soldering Copper Pipe.
How to Cut and Solder
Requirement 7 asks you to solder three copper
tube connections.
The following steps will help you complete
this requirement:
Step 1—Measure
the pipe to divide
it into two equal
sections. Mark it
with a dark pencil.
Place the pipe in
your vise, cushion-
ing it to prevent
vise marks or bend-
ing the pipe. Allow
enough pipe to stick
out so that your
pipe cutter can turn
freely. Place the
cutting disk exactly
on your mark and
start turning the cutter shaft. Twist the handle
clockwise as you turn. Complete the cut slowly so
that you leave as little burr as possible. Burrs can
cause leaks.
Step 2—Use the reamer as you did with your
steel pipe to remove the burrs from the cut ends
of the inside of the copper pipe.
Step 3—Use steel wool, sand cloth, or fine
sandpaper to burnish the outside and end of
the pipe and the inside of the coupling. To keep
the burnished areas free from new oils, try
not to touch these places with your fingers.
Materials
■■ Propane or acetylene
propane gas torch
■■ Lead-free solder
(wire type)
■■ Noncorrosive flux
■■ Steel wool or sand
cloth (emery paper)
■■ Vise or clamp
■■ Pipe cutter suitable
for copper
■■ 3 feet of 1/2" or 3/4"
rigid copper pipe
■■ Tee of proper size
■■ Coupling
Instead of a pipe cutter, you can use a
hacksaw with a fine-toothed blade to
cut the tubing. A miter box will help you
make a straight cut. Slanted cuts are not
acceptable when joining pipes.

PLUMBING 37
.Soldering Copper Pipe
Step 4—Apply noncorrosive flux to the outside of the pipe
and to the inside of the end of the coupling you are going to
use. Twist the pipe into the coupling to make sure the flux is
evenly distributed.
Step 5—Light the torch, turning it up to
a soft flame. Evenly heat the pipe joint.
As soon as the flux is bubbling well and
the pipe is hot enough to melt solder, turn
off the torch. Gently push the solder into
the joint as shown. It should flow freely
around and into the joint. When smooth
silver shows all around the fitting, you can
cool the joint with a damp (not wet) cloth
or sponge. Be careful not to burn yourself.
The water on the cloth will soon carry the
heat to your hand.
Step 6—Remove the burr from your
second piece of tubing, burnish and flux
the tubing and coupling, and solder the
other side of the coupling exactly as you
did the first piece.
Step 7—Remove the burr from both open
tubing ends and solder the tee to one of
them. Follow the same process as you did
before to complete the project.
Use enough flux to just barely
cover the necessary surface.
Do not use more flux than is
needed. Brush off any excess.
Do not touch the flux, because
it will chemically burn you.
Pull out about 10 inches of solder
wire and bend it at an angle.
This preparation will help you
maneuver the solder without
burning your fingers.

Home Plumbing Repairs
Shutting off the water is always the first thing you must do
before making a home plumbing repair. Some home plumbing
repairs can be made without shutting off the main supply valve,
as long as an individual shutoff valve for the pipe that feeds the
repair area has been shut off. For instance, if you are planning
to replace a faucet seat washer, you may find the shutoff valve
underneath the sink or lavatory (bathroom sink). If no such
valve has been installed, or if you find the individual valve is
not working correctly, you must shut off the main valve in the
basement or crawl space or near your water meter outside.
Faucets
There are two main types of faucets:
compression and noncompression.
If your faucet has two handles, one for
hot and one for cold, it is most likely a
compression faucet.
Compression faucets also are known as
stem faucets because when you turn the
handle to the “off” position, the stem moves
down. A rubber washer at the bottom of the
stem presses into the valve seat and blocks
the flow of water. If the washer is worn or
crumbling, it will not seal out water. That
little bit of water getting past the washer
causes a drip, drip, drip. It’s a waste of a
vital natural resource, and it becomes expen-
sive over time.
Replacing a Washer in a Compression Faucet
A leaky faucet is annoying, and it wastes water. You can
fix many faucet drips yourself if you know how to change
a washer.

Step 1—Turn off the water. Usually, you will
find a pair of shutoff valves under the sink.
Check to make sure the shutoff valves work.
Sometimes they need repairing and do not stop
the water completely. If the water still runs
from the faucet after you have shut it off under
the sink, have an experienced adult help you
turn off the water supply at your home’s main
water-supply valve.
Step 2—Turn the handles to the faucets “on”
to drain the remaining water from the pipes.
Next, close the stopper in the sink so that no
small parts will be lost down the drain. Lay a
towel in the sink to prevent nicks and scratches.
Step 3—Begin taking the faucet apart by find-
ing the screw that holds the handle. Sometimes
the screw is hidden by the escutcheon, or
decorative cap, which indicates “H” for hot
or “C” for cold. Pry off the cap with the tip of
a flathead (slot) screwdriver. Protect chrome
surfaces by padding them with a cloth while
you work.
Step 4—After removing the screw, take off the
handle. If the handle is hard to remove, gently
tap or pry it on one side, then another. Do not
pry too hard, or you might crack the handle or
faucet body. (If the handle is really stuck, a tool
called a “handle puller” can be used to grasp
the handle and pull it off the stem.)
Step 5—Remove the retaining nut (also called
a lock nut or packing nut) with an adjustable
wrench. Turn counterclockwise to loosen.

As you take apart the faucet, carefully lay each piece on a nearby towel in
the order that you remove it. This important practice will help you know
how to put the faucet back together after you have replaced the old parts.


40 PLUMBING
Home Plumbing Repairs.
Step 6—Remove the stem by turning in the direction you would
use to turn on that side of the faucet until the stem comes out.
Sometimes one side is the right-hand thread and the opposite is
the left-hand thread.
Step 7—Use a screwdriver to take off the brass screw that holds
the washer in place. If the screw is stuck, use a bit of super
lubricant such as Liquid Wrench to help loosen it.
Step 8—Clean any dirt or corrosion off permanent parts with an
old toothbrush or fine steel wool before putting the faucet back
together. Dip the brush or steel wool in vinegar to help dissolve
mineral deposits on parts.
Step 9—Choose a washer that is the exact shape, size, and
thickness as the old washer. All-purpose repair kits for com-
pression faucets contain a variety of washers, but if you
cannot find a match, take the old washer to the hardware
store. The brand name of your faucet also will help you
identify the correct washer.
Step 10—If your kit has a new screw that matches the old
one, use it to attach the new washer to the stem. Put the
flat side of the washer against the base. Put the faucet back
together in the reverse order of how you took it apart. Turn
on the water, and see if you have fixed the leak.
If the spout is dripping, replacing the washer or fixing the
valve seat probably will stop the leak. However, if the handles
are dripping, the O-ring and/or packing is probably to blame.
You can try tightening the retaining nut first. Pry off the O-ring
and replace it, using silicone gel on the new one. Wrap new
packing around the stem. Packing string is made of rubber or
Teflon, and it creates a waterproof seal.
Repairing Noncompression Faucets
Many noncompression faucets have one handle to adjust the
hot and cold water. Some have two handles and look like
compression faucets until you take them apart.
Remember, turning right tightens (“righty, tighty”).
Turning left loosens (“lefty, loosey”). Right turns are
clockwise, and left are counterclockwise.


PLUMBING 41
.Home Plumbing Repairs
Noncompression faucets do not have washers. Instead,
they have a ball mechanism, a disk mechanism, or a cartridge.
Noncompression faucets can also be fairly simple to repair.
The key to repairing and replacing parts for these faucets is to:
• Know the make and model number of your faucet or take
the parts with you to the hardware store so you can find the
correct replacements.
• Remember when taking apart the
faucets to keep track of the order of the
parts. You can write down or sketch
the assembly.
For detailed instructions on your
type of noncompression faucet, check
out a plumbing book from the list of
recommended books in the resources
section of this pamphlet.
Repairing Shower Faucets
Shower faucets are similar to those on a
sink or lavatory. Because of the positioning
of the faucet body in the wall behind plas-
ter and tile, their stems are usually quite
long. You may need to use a socket wrench
to remove the stem nut. Treat shower
faucets like any other compression faucet
when the shower head drips water. Make
sure the seats are in good condition and
replace washers and packing as needed.
Cleaning Pipes and Traps
All waste pipes can get clogged. Dirt may
collect in the bottom, and grease can stick
to the sides. When water or waste will not

run out of a sink, tub, or toilet, the problem is that debris is
blocking the route in the pipe or trap. Try the following remedies.
If the first one does not work, move on to the next one listed
until you clear the blockage.
1. Remove the stopper or drain cover. Clean off any
accumulation of soap scum and hair with paper towels
and pipe cleaners.
2. Try a commercial drain cleaner. Commercial drain
cleaners can help clear a clog that is causing a sink or tub
to drain slowly. Give the cleaner plenty of time to work—
a few minutes longer than specified on the package. If the
drain is still slow, do not risk a chemical burn by imme-
diately trying repairs involving augers, cleanout plugs, or
trap removal. Continue to use the sink or tub to completely
flush out the chemical. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s
instructions. Try further repairs in a day or so.
3. Loosen a clog with suction.
Petroleum jelly applied to the base of a plunger
helps seal it to the sink. Block the overflow
holes or any other sink drains with wet rags
(someone should hold it in place). Fill a sink
with enough water to cover the plunger and
create more of a seal. If you are plunging a
toilet, leave enough water in the toilet to create
a seal but not so much that it overflows when
you plunge. Use steady, rhythmic, and forceful
downward strokes to clear the clog. Plunge 10
times, and then test the flow. Repeat the proce-
dure three to five times, if necessary. Once the
water drains freely in a sink, flush the drain
with hot water for five minutes.
Never use caustic commercial chemical drain cleaners in a com-
pletely clogged drain or in a toilet. Flush any chemicals thoroughly
from the trap to be worked on. If the chemicals cannot be flushed
out, it is time for a responsible adult or plumber to take over.


PLUMBING 43
.Home Plumbing Repairs
4. Insert a “snake,” or auger,
into the drain or pipe to
dislodge a persistent clog.
Before you begin, use towels
to protect the surface from
chips or scratches. Do not be
too forceful with the auger.
5. Clean the trap. If all else fails,
place a container under the trap
to catch the water. Open the
cleanout plug. If there is no
cleanout plug, remove the trap.
Keep the pail under the trap, and
loosen the slip nuts. Pad the teeth
of an adjustable wrench with
tape or cloth to protect the metal
finish. You can use a wrench to
loosen the slip nuts for the first
turn, and then do the rest of the
turning by hand. Support the trap
with one hand so that it will not
fall unexpectedly.
Be careful when working on a fixture that has a similar fixture behind
it. The drain snake may travel through a double tee in the pipe into the
other fixture instead of down the drain pipe.

Clean the removed trap by

Use an auger to clear the
pipes that attach to either
side of the trap. When
replacing the trap, wrap
the “male threads” of the
trap with Teflon pipe tape,
or brush them with joint
compound. Put the trap
and the washers into posi-
tion, and turn the slip nuts
by hand. Because slip nuts
crush easily, hand-tighten
them first. Then use a
wrench to give them an
additional quarter turn.
Check your work by
plugging the basin of your sink and filling it with water. Then
remove the plug and inspect the trap and drain fittings for
leaks. You may need to tighten the slip nuts a bit more.
Repairing Toilets
There are two types of toilets: gravity-assist flush toilets and
pressure-assist toilets. All gravity-assist flush toilets operate basi-
cally the same way. When you flush the toilet, the handle lifts
an arm or chain that raises the flush valve, which can be either
a ball (in older toilets) or a flapper. Tank water flows out of this
opening to flush the toilet bowl. The float ball rides the water
level down the tank and turns on the water-intake valve in the
ballcock. At the same time, the flush valve drops back into the
opening, sealing it to fill the tank again with fresh water.
Pressure-assist toilets are becoming more popular, especially
with federally mandated standards for how much water a toilet
can use in one flush. Pressure-assist toilets “push” the contents
out of the toilet bowl rather than using the pulling action of
gravity as in the gravity-assist toilet. Inside the china toilet tank,
you will not find any standing water, as in a gravity-assist
toilet, so one advantage is that the tank of a pressure-assist
toilet never “sweats” in heat and humidity.

off valve at the side of the toilet.
Step 2—Drain excess water from the bowl with an old cup or

Sometimes you can see
obstructions using a small mirror
and flashlight. With the mirror,
you can look under the rim to see
whether the flush holes are clear.
If they are not, try clearing them
with the hook end of a straightened
clothes hanger. You also can inspect
the top of the trap with the mirror
and flashlight—but empty all the
water out of the toilet bowl first. If
the clog persists, it is probably time

A running toilet, one that is
constantly letting water into the
tank, is both irritating and waste-
ful. It also is one of the easiest and
least expensive toilet problems to
fix. You might want to drain the
tank first by turning off the water
supply and flushing. Remember
to turn the water supply back on
when repairs are done.
Running toilets can have
several causes and easy remedies.
Remember, turn off the water
supply before performing
maintenance or repairs.
ADJUSTMENT
SCREW
The insides of gravity-assist toilets may vary.
With a floating cup ballcock (above left), the
position of the floating cup controls the water
level. You can adjust the water level by moving
the spring clip. To make water-level adjustments
with the floatless ballcock (above right), simply
turn the adjustment screw.

Problem Solution
Leaking float ball Unscrew the ball to remove it, and
install a new one. If a new one is
temporarily unavailable, empty the
leaky ball, cover it with a plastic bag,
and secure the bag with tape or a
rubber band.
Float arm If the rod is keeping the water-intake
valve open, bend the rod up or down
slightly, or adjust its screw.
Leaky water intake Clean corrosion off washers and other
valve parts with a toothbrush dipped in
vinegar, or install new ones.
Faulty flush valve seat Raise the valve and buff the seat with
steel wool. Remove only corrosion, not
any metal.
Worn flush valve
(flapper)
A replacement flapper slides over
the overflow pipe or hooks onto lugs.
If replacing a flush valve ball, unscrew
it from the lift wire. Make sure that the
new valve ball falls squarely into the
seat of the flush valve.
Toilet tank overfills Examine the flush valve; the repair may
be as simple as replacing
the flap.
Water is going over
the overflow tube
Adjust the float arm, adjustment
screw, or spring clip. If the water
continues to fill past the overflow
tube, replace the fill valve.
