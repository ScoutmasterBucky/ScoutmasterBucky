Nuclear Science: Going Beyond Chemistry.
Nuclear Science:
Going Beyond Chemistry
Science began when humans first sought to understand nature
as the interactions of forces and matter. What causes seasons?
What are stars? Why do we get sick? These questions once
were dismissed as mysteries: Deities or spirits caused things to
happen for reasons people could not understand. Science pro-
poses to understand nature’s materials and processes so we can
predict and control events in our lives.

.Nuclear Science: Going Beyond Chemistry
Over 2,000 years of science, researchers learned principles
of matter and how it behaves. Within the last 200 years,
we discovered that all substances are made of about 100
elements—each made of a unique kind of atom. Studying the
characteristics of atoms and their interactions became the field
of chemistry.
Physicists continued to try to understand the structure
of atoms. They learned that all atoms are made of a few sub-
atomic particles. Some atoms transform and give off radiation.
Investigators moved atoms around using electrical charges and
shot atoms or parts of atoms into each other, broke atoms
down, and built them up. They built huge machines to break
atoms apart to study their subatomic particles.
The study of atomic structure is still a part of the field of
nuclear science. Nuclear science also
• Investigates natural and manufactured radiation—how they
are produced and their practical uses
• Explains the principles applied to protect people
from radiation
• Examines how atomic nuclei behave when they join together
or split apart
• Seeks to understand the processes that occurred at the very
beginning of the universe
Just as with science in general, nuclear science gives us a
simpler—and at the same time more interesting—explanation
of the natural world. The ultimate goal of nuclear science is to
find out if there is one fundamental rule that explains how
matter and forces interact. Earning the Nuclear Science merit
badge is a chance for you to learn about this exciting field at
the cutting edge of science today.
It doesn’t take a nuclear physicist to understand
the basics of nuclear science. A little background in
chemistry and physics will help, but even for the
nonscientific Scout, the Nuclear Science merit badge
lies well within grasp.


8 NUCLEAR SCIENCE
The Nature of Atoms.
The Nature
of Atoms
The idea that everything is made of
atoms goes back to the Greek philosopher
Leucippus, who lived about 400 B.C.E.
Leucippus and his student Democritus
were among the first to believe that if you
cut a piece of any material, such as copper,
and cut it again and again many times, you
would finally end up with a piece of the
material that could not be cut. This would
be an atom of that substance. Democritus
believed (mistakenly) that atoms were
held together by little hooks. Later, the
philosopher Lucretius included the work of Leucippus and
Democritus into his work De Rerum Natura (On the Nature
of Things).
Not everyone was convinced. Plato, Aristotle, and other
early scientists did not believe in atoms. Aristotle’s ideas became
the basis of science for more than a thousand years. But in the
15th century, Lucretius’ work was rediscovered. Over many
years scientists like Copernicus, Galileo, Francis Bacon, and Isaac
Newton began to disagree with the great Aristotle on many ideas,
including atoms.
Structure of an atom
An atom is the smallest piece or unit of an element
having the properties of that element. Elements are
fundamental substances that can’t be broken into
simpler substances by chemical means. Familiar
elements include hydrogen, oxygen, copper, and gold.
Each element consists of one basic kind of atom.

Titus Lucretius
Carus (circa
99–55 B.C.E.), a
Roman poet
and philosopher,
mentioned atoms
in his famous Latin
work De Rerum
Natura (On the
Nature of Things).


NUCLEAR SCIENCE 9
.The Nature of Atoms
John Dalton’s Theory of Atoms
By 1803, John Dalton of England had done much work to prove
that atoms exist. He combined his own work with that of other
scientists to show how atoms behave in different conditions and
to estimate the masses of different atoms. His theory of atoms
was the first to explain chemical reactions as atoms combining
and recombining with other atoms.
Amedeo Avogadro in Italy came up with a better way to
measure the masses of atoms. He showed that Dalton was on
the right track but had made some mistakes. Avogadro was a
good scientist but not a good writer. His work was not under-
stood until another Italian, Stanislao Cannizzaro, explained
Avogadro’s ideas in 1858. Cannizzaro was the first to use the
word molecule to describe chemical combinations of atoms.
By the 1870s, scientists everywhere were studying atoms.
In Russia, Dmitri Mendeleev divided atoms into groups and rep-
resented them on a chart. Some of his ideas were wrong, but
other scientists corrected his chart, and today this is the highly
useful periodic table of the elements.
The Discovery of Ions and Electrons
Researchers continued to study the nature of atoms. Svante
Arrhenius of Sweden found that some atoms carry an electric
charge. These atoms could move through water and cause
chemical reactions. He named them ions from the Greek word
for “traveler.”
Atoms are the smallest bit of an element, and differ-
ent elements have atoms of different masses. Mass is
the amount of matter that something contains. Your
mass is always the same, while your weight might
change if you go to a different place. In space, for
instance, your weight is zero, but your mass is the
same as it is on Earth.
What Avogadro
discovered the
hard way in the
1800s—that scien-
tists must be able
to write clearly if
they want others
to understand
their findings—is
still true today.

NUCLEAR SCIENCE 11
.The Nature of Atoms
G.J. Stoney of Ireland studied electricity. He explained
electric current as the movement of extremely small, negatively
charged particles. In 1891 he used the name electrons for
these particles.
In 1897, the British physicist J.J. Thomson proved the
existence of electrons and showed that all atoms contain them.
He believed (mistakenly) that the electrons were stuck in the
atoms like raisins in a cake, and (correctly) that ions happen
when an atom has either too many or too few electrons.
Isotopes—Alike but Different
Scientists learned more by studying different kinds of atoms.
In the early 1900s, Frederick Soddy of England investigated
lead atoms and found three
different “forms” of lead.
These atoms had different
masses, but they all reacted
chemically like lead. Soddy named atoms of the same element
with different masses isotopes, meaning “same place” in Greek.
Parts of the Atom
At about the same time, Ernest Rutherford of New Zealand made
the first of his many important discoveries. He confirmed what
others believed—that an atom is mostly empty space with a tiny
core in the center. He called this core the nucleus (plural, nuclei).
Rutherford described the nucleus as being the middle of the
atom, with the electrons going around it like a swarm of bees.
Sir Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937), known as
“the father of nuclear physics,” discovered
and named some of the field’s fundamental
ideas: alpha, beta, and gamma rays; the
nucleus; the proton; and half-life. In 1908,
Rutherford won the Nobel Prize in chemis-
try for showing that radioactive elements
become other elements when they decay.
Most important was his discovery of the
nucleus, the atom’s core. (Note that during
this time, nuclear science was still considered
a part of chemistry—the study of how
atoms combine.)
Ionization is
any process that
gives atoms an
electric charge.
Isotopes are atoms
with the same
number of protons,
a different number
of neutrons, different
masses, and have
the same chemistry.
They may have very
different physics and
some isotopes are
radioactive.


12 NUCLEAR SCIENCE
The Nature of Atoms.
By 1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr made a major
advance in the understanding of the atom. His model had the
nucleus in the middle but with electrons traveling in rings or
“orbits” around it, like planets orbiting the sun. The further
from the nucleus the electron is, the more energy it has.
About the same time, Henry Moseley of England found a
way to determine the number of positive electric charges in a
nucleus. He called this the atomic number of the atom.
After Moseley’s death in World War I, his work on atomic
numbers continued in Germany, France, and Britain. Ernest
Rutherford predicted scientists would soon find a piece of an
atom that carried one positive charge. Rutherford proved him-
self correct with his discovery of the proton in 1914.
The Neutron
During this period, William Harkins of the United States and
Antoine-Philibert Masson of Australia were working on a big
question: Why was atomic number different from atomic mass?
Based on their work, Rutherford predicted the existence of a
particle in the nucleus that had mass but no electrical charge.
Researchers looked for this neutral particle. Rutherford
and James Chadwick of England tried experiments, which
failed. Finally in 1932, 12 years after Rutherford’s prediction,
Chadwick found the neutron—a particle of an atom about the
mass of a proton but with no electric charge.
The discovery of the neutron helped scientists explain both
the atomic mass of an atom and what isotopes were. The total
number of protons and neutrons of an atom is the mass number.
Isotopes, therefore, are atoms with the same atomic number (the
same number of protons) but different mass numbers (different
numbers of neutrons).
The atomic number, or Z, is the number of protons in the nucleus of an
atom. This defines an element as atoms with the same atomic number. The
atomic number determines the place of the element in the periodic table.
The mass number, or A, of an atom is the sum of the protons and neu-
trons in its nucleus. The atomic mass is the actual measure of mass
(amount of matter) in the nucleus. An oxygen atom, for example, with
eight protons and eight neutrons, has a mass number of 16. The atomic
mass of oxygen is 15.99491461 atomic mass units (AMU). An AMU is a
tiny unit used to measure the masses of atoms and molecules.


NUCLEAR SCIENCE 13
.The Nature of Atoms
After the neutron’s discovery, Werner Heisenberg suggested
the nucleus was made of only protons and neutrons. Niels Bohr
changed his own model to explain properties of atoms based on
all three subatomic particles. Protons and neutrons (also called
nucleons) make up the nucleus; electrons swirl around the
nucleus in shells.
Exploring an Ever-Smaller World
As scientists improve the tools and techniques of nuclear science,
we develop a better understanding of the particles and forces that
make up the natural world. This increases our ability to explain
the behavior of matter and to re-create particles that have not
existed in nature since the beginning of the universe.
Antimatter
Antimatter, once only imagined in science fiction, has been found
to exist in the real world. In 1928, theoretical physicist Paul Dirac
predicted that, for every kind of matter, there existed an equal and
opposite antimatter. If regular matter and antimatter came together,
both would disappear. The only trace of their mutual annihilation
would be a burst of energy left behind.
In 1932 at the California Institute of Technology, Carl
Anderson was studying cloud chamber photographs of particles
passing through a magnetic field. (See “Build a Cloud Chamber”
in the chapter “What Is Radiation?”) One picture showed an
electron that turned opposite the way it should have. This anti-
electron had a positive charge and behaved exactly the opposite
of a normal electron. Anderson called it the positron because of
its positive charge. This was the first observation of antimatter in
our world.
New discoveries modified Bohr’s idea of orbiting
electrons. By 1928, physicists had a fuller picture of
the behavior of electrons. The work of Austrians Erwin
Schrödinger and Wolfgang Pauli and Germans Max
Born and Werner Heisenberg showed that electrons
do not move in fixed orbits. An electron moves unpre-
dictably within a space that may have a spherical or
dumbbell shape. The shape of the electron’s travel
depends on its energy and the type of shell it is in.
An electron shell
is the region
around the
nucleus in which
electrons of
the same
energy move.


14 NUCLEAR SCIENCE
The Nature of Atoms.
Particle accelerator experiments
discovered more examples of anti-
particles. These confirmed Dirac’s
earlier predictions. Now, accelera-
tors produce antimatter nuclei and
atoms. Although antimatter is not
seen as a practical way to generate
useful energy, it is imagined as an
efficient energy storage system, and
there are visionary proposals to use antimatter to power future
generations of spacecraft.
Neutrinos
In 1930 Wolfgang Pauli predicted a particle with no charge
and almost no mass. Detecting it would be difficult because it
didn’t seem to “do” anything—it didn’t interact with matter like
ionizing radiation did. (See the chapter “What Is Radiation?”)
Pauli envisioned it as a sort of “ghost particle” because it would
pass through regular matter with almost no interaction.
It took 26 years before Fred Reines and Clyde Cowan (1995
Nobel Prize winners) gathered hard evidence that the neutrinos
Pauli predicted really exist. In 1962, Leon Lederman, Melvin
When matter meets antimatter, they both
disappear in a burst of energy.
ENERGY
ELECTRON ANTIELECTRON
Richard Feynman (1918–1988) was a 1965 Nobel Prize winner and one
of the most influential physicists of the 20th century. He described how
charged particles (and their antiparticles) interact through electromag-
netic force—or, simply put, how light and matter interact. To analyze and
accurately predict these particle interactions, he developed a new form
of mathematics.

Antimatter behaves exactly the opposite of its regular

NUCLEAR SCIENCE 15
.The Nature of Atoms
Schwartz, and Jack Steinberger (1988 Nobel laureates) used
the Brookhaven National Laboratory accelerator to produce
evidence of two types of neutrinos.
Neutrinos can pass through solid matter with only a slight
chance of a collision. A beam of neutrinos can travel completely
through Earth without losing intensity. The ability of neutrinos
to penetrate matter makes them useful in the study of particles.
Using particle accelerators, physicists have learned much about
the makeup of neutrons and protons by observing rare collisions
between neutrinos and atomic nuclei.
Continuing Discoveries About the Nucleus
Physicists have learned that the nucleus often behaves as if it
were a raindrop, moving fluidly, constantly changing shape like
a drop of liquid. It can be round like a tennis ball or shaped
like a football. It can vibrate or, if football-shaped, spin. James
Rainwater, Aage Bohr, and Ben Mottelson described the motions
of the nucleus and shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in physics for
their work on the structure of the nucleus.
Some atoms are known to be stable, while other isotopes of
the same element can be unstable. Stability in an atom means
that it does not give off any form of radiation. For example, of
the 14 isotopes of carbon, 12 of them undergo radioactive decay
and two (carbon-12 and carbon-13) are stable. Maria Goeppert-
Mayer and J. Hans D. Jensen (1963 Nobel laureates) created the
nuclear shell model to explain this. They figured out that protons
and neutrons in stable nuclei move like pairs of dancers, spin-
ning together clockwise or counterclockwise. As they spin, they
move around in “shells” or defined spaces inside the nucleus.
Goeppert-Mayer and Jensen found that a nucleus with its shells
exactly filled tends to be stable.
A nuclide is a
nucleus that exists
for a measurable
length of time.


16 NUCLEAR SCIENCE
The Standard Model: Elementary Particles.
The Standard Model:
Elementary Particles
In 1964, Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig of the California
Institute of Technology proposed that even protons and neutrons
could be broken down into simpler particles.
Quarks
Using particle accelerators, researchers shattered protons and
neutrons into pieces that Gell-Mann named quarks. In 1990,
Jerome Friedman, Henry Kendall, and Richard Taylor shared the
Nobel Prize in physics for showing that protons and neutrons
do indeed have much smaller particles—quarks—inside them.
Experiments have identified six quarks: up and down, which
make up most everyday matter; and the much heavier top,
bottom, strange, and charm quarks, which are unstable. Protons
consist of two up quarks and one down quark. Neutrons have
two down quarks and one up quark. Particles called gluons keep
the quarks from flying away from each other.
Leptons
Quarks are called elementary particles because they have no
known smaller parts. There is another type of elementary
particle called leptons. The best-known lepton is the electron,
but physicists have identified five others. The six leptons are
divided into three families: (1) the electron and its neutrino;
(2) the muon and its neutrino; and (3) the tau and its neutrino.
Quarks determine if proton or neutron.
Protons determine chemical properties.
Ratio of neutrons to protons make a nucleus
stable or unstable.

.The Standard Model: Elementary Particles
David Gross, David Politzer, and Frank Wilczek won
the 2004 Nobel Prize in physics for showing how the
attraction between quarks is strong when they are far
apart but weak when they are close together. This
discovery showed that a gluon provides the force that
keeps quarks bound inside a nucleus and the force
that keeps nuclei together. The work is an important
step toward providing a unified (single) description of
all the forces of nature, from the tiny distances within
the nucleus of an atom to the enormous expanse of
the universe.
The electron, the muon, and the tau have electrical charge.
The other leptons—the three neutrinos—do not.
Electrons are stable. The muon and the tau are more massive
than the electron, and they are unstable. They are short-lived and
are not found in ordinary matter at all.

Quarks form the fundamental building blocks of protons and
neutrons. Gluons keep the quarks together. Note: The symbols
on the Nuclear Science merit badge reflect the quarks’ structure
of protons and neutrons.

The Standard Model: Elementary Particles.
“The Standard Model” is the current theory of the
structure of matter. It says that matter is made up
of quarks and leptons that interact by exchanging
force-carrying particles. The chart shows the elemen-
tary particles that are thought to make up all of the
physical world and make matter behave as it does.
Force Carriers
The elementary particles interact; that is, they affect one another
because of particles called force carriers. The gluon that binds
quarks together is a force carrier. Another force carrier is the
photon, which carries the electromagnetic force that acts between
electrically charged particles. The force carriers W boson and Z
boson transmit the weak force that acts on quarks and leptons
but only for distances smaller than an atomic nucleus.
Elementary
particles of
matter—
quarks and
leptons—have
no measurable
size. Physicists
describe them
as “pointlike.”

Make 3-D Models of Isotopes
Models that can be touched are called physical models. (The Standard
Model is a mental model—a model of ideas.) You will make physical
models of isotopes to help explain to your merit badge counselor the
difference between mass number and atomic number and the differ-
ence between the atom, nuclear, and quark structures of isotopes.
Begin by studying pictures of the three isotopes of hydrogen.
Hydrogen is the simplest and lightest element. Ordinary hydrogen has
one proton, one electron, and no neutrons. In isotope notation, ordinary
hydrogen is 1H. There are two other hydrogen isotopes: deuterium
(written in isotope notation as 2D) with 1 proton and 1 neutron, and
tritium (3T or 3H) with 1 proton and 2 neutrons.
Now use your imagination (and whatever materials are handy)
to make a 3-D model of each isotope. Successful atomic models have
been made with pizza or cookies or Styrofoam balls. On the next
page is an example to get you thinking about the three isotopes of
hydrogen. If you wish, you can make models of three isotopes of an
element other than hydrogen, like carbon.

How To Build Isotope Models
Materials You Will Need
q 3 large clear plastic fillable balls or ornaments
(label one “Proton” and two “Neutron”)
q 1 small white pompom (the electron)
q 1 pipe cleaner (the electric attractive force)
Build a Hydrogen Atom
Bend one end of the pipe cleaner around the loop of the proton
ball. Bend the other end around the white pompom.
If a hydrogen atom were the size of a football stadium, the proton
would be the size of a marble, and the electron and quarks would be
too small to see.
Build a Deuterium Atom
Add the neutron ball to the pipe cleaner. The neutron and proton
should touch.
The neutron and the proton have about the same mass, but much
more mass than the electron. A proton has almost 2,000 times as much
mass as an electron.

so that it touches both the other neutron and the proton.
Tritium is radioactive, with a half-life of 12.3 years, changing into
Helium-3.
How To Build Quark Models
You could also build a model to represent quarks.
Materials You Will Need
q 5 medium red pompoms (for the down quarks)
q 4 medium blue pompoms (for the up quarks).
Build a Proton
Put two red balls and one blue ball in a transparent ball.
Real quarks are not stationary, but are always moving inside their
proton. Quark containment means you cannot separate a single quark
from a proton.
Build a Neutron
Put one red pompom and two blue pompoms in a transparent ball.
In the nucleus of a real atom,
extremely strong forces hold
the protons and neutrons
together. A huge amount of
energy is concentrated in the
nucleus because of these
strong holding forces.

Learn About Particle Accelerators
Particle accelerators, sometimes called atom smashers, are machines that
can create beams of electrically charged particles and accelerate them
to nearly the speed of light. This acceleration increases the particles’
energy of motion. Think of the difference between catching a baseball
that is gently underhanded to you and catching a fastball fired at you
by a major-league pitcher. Energy is the universal container that holds
things together. If you want to break open a container such as an atom
or a proton to see what’s inside, you must overcome that container’s
energy. From accelerators, scientists get the energy they need to break
open and explore the makeup of atomic and subatomic particles.
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland, is the
world’s largest and highest-energy particle accelerator. Scientists use
the LHC’s 17-mile-long underground ring to smash beams of protons
or heavy ions into one another. Physicists are using the collider to help
explain the interactions and forces among the elementary particles and
to test theories about the structure of the universe.
The Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider at Brookhaven National
Laboratory in Upton, New York, accel-
erates ions to relativistic (near-light)
speeds and smashes them together.
The goal is to re-create a quark-gluon
plasma—the super-hot, ultra-dense,
soup-like form of matter that existed
in the universe’s first microseconds,
beginning the formation of the
universe as we know it.
The Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility in Newport
News, Virginia, is a fixed-target
accelerator that creates a continu-
ous stream of high-energy elec-
trons. The machine steers the elec-
trons into stationary nuclei, which
shatter into smaller particles.
A high-energy collision of gold nuclei
by the STAR experiment at Brookhaven
National Laboratory produced the
pattern shown in this picture.

Scientists analyze these fragments to measure and study the quark con-
tent of the nucleus.
The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University
is the most powerful heavy-ion accelerator where scientists study the
structure of atomic nuclei.
The Advanced Light Source, a division of Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, produces light—mainly
X-rays—with special qualities. Scientists use these X-rays to probe the
structure of atoms and molecules, explore the properties of materials,
investigate chemical reactions, analyze samples for trace elements, and
even manufacture microscopic machines.
Other particle accelerators operate at universities and national laborato-
ries across the United States. Your counselor can help you find one to visit.
One example is the: Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (CAMS),
at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California. CAMS
is used for a broad range of scientific missions such as climate change,
forensics, radiocarbon-dating, and public health.
Linear accelerators can be used for medicine, too. For instance, using
a beam of protons or particles to destroy hard-to-reach tumors or tumors
resistant to other forms of treatment.
During your visit, ask questions. These will get you started.
• How does the accelerator work? Is it a linac (linear accelerator) or
a circular accelerator?
• What type of particles does it accelerate?
• How much energy does it take to run the accelerator?
• What type of experiments is it designed to do? What questions does
the research seek to answer?
• What are the most exciting discoveries that have been made here?
• What types of people work here? What is it like to work here? What
training do you need to get a position here?
• Are there radiation hazards around this machine? Why or why not?
How are people protected from potential hazards?


You too can build cloud chamber, a vessel that shows the paths or tracks of
electrically charged particles passing through. See instructions on page 32.

.What Is Radiation?
What Is Radiation?
The German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen discovered
X-rays while experimenting with a glass vacuum tube in
1895. He covered the tube with black paper and passed an
electric current through the tube. A dark image appeared on
a photographic plate nearby.
Roentgen assumed that unknown, invisible rays were
coming from the vacuum tube and darkening his photographic
plates. The rays passed easily through the paper covering the
tube. What other materials would they penetrate?
Roentgen tried to block X-rays and found that some mate-
rials worked and some did not. The bones of a human hand
blocked the rays, but the soft parts or flesh of a hand did not.
He found he could photograph the bone structure of his wife’s
hand with the rays.
X-rays proved to be important not only in medicine, but
also in giving scientists new insights into the nature of radiation
and the structure of the atom. Scientists soon found that X-rays
made ions of the atoms in air. Because of this, we call X-rays
ionizing radiation.
Roentgen called
his discovery
X-rays because
he could not
identify them.
Roentgen’s discovery won him the 1901 Nobel Prize
in physics, revolutionized medicine, and opened the
door to future advancement in physics.
Radiation is any energy or particle that comes from a source and travels
from one place to another. Sunlight, sound waves, and microwaves are
types of radiation. The high-energy kind of radiation produced by X-ray
machines or given off by radioactive elements is ionizing radiation.
Sunlight, sound, and microwaves do not make ions. They are nonionizing.
In this pamphlet, the term “radiation” generally means ionizing radiation.


26 NUCLEAR SCIENCE
What Is Radiation?.
Radioactivity in Nature
Henri Becquerel, a French scientist, discovered that uranium,
like X-rays, would fog a photographic plate. Uranium made
rays of its own. In 1898, Marie Curie named this property
radioactivity. A radioactive element gives off charged particles,
or rays.
Becquerel wanted to know if the radiation from uranium
caused ions in air like X-rays. To find out, he created a box
with two metal leaves hanging from a metal rod. If the rod or
bar is charged with electricity, the metal leaves will become
charged. Because the same types of electrical charges repel
each other, the leaves will repel each other and stand apart.
Becquerel named his invention the electroscope.
If the air in the electroscope becomes ionized, the charge
will leak out of the leaves. Becquerel found that uranium
brought near the electroscope would discharge it. This told
him that uranium radiation was ionizing radiation.
In 1910, Theodore
Wolf, a French
Jesuit priest, used
an electroscope
to show that
radiation is
all around us
every day.
An electroscope can detect ionizing radiation.

Step 1—Clean and dry the
canning jar.
Step 2—Trace around the lid of the jar onto the Styrofoam plate with a pen
and cut out the circle. This will be the lid of the jar.
Step 3—Use the pushpin to poke a small hole in the center of Styrofoam.
Cut a 1½-inch piece of the plastic coffee stirrer and place into the hole in the
Styrofoam circle.
Step 4—Make a small hook on one end of

coffee stirrer and place through the hole in
the Styrofoam lid.
If you need a source for the thorium gas lantern mantle for building
an electroscope, visit Gas-Lights.com with your parent or guardian’s
permission and look for Coleman lantern mantles containing
thorium. Thorium makes a bright white light.

Step 5—Cut two small leaves about an inch
long from the Pop-Tart® wrapper. With the
pushpin, punch a small hole in the pointy end.
Carefully thread both leaves through wire.
Step 6—Heat a spoonful of table salt in an oven
at 350 degrees, then drop the salt into the dry
bottle or use desiccant. This will absorb mois-
ture from the air in the bottle.
Place lid with leaves onto jar, tape around jar
to make airtight. The leaves should not touch
the bottom of the jar. Crumble up a 1-inch ball
of aluminum foil and place on top of the wire
outside the jar.
To use your electroscope:
Step 1—Comb your hair with a
plastic comb and touch the comb
to the wire’s top loop. This gives
the leaves electrical charges alike.
They will repel each other. As
they lose their charge, they will
come back together. This process
takes about five minutes.
Step 2—Obtain a piece of a
gas lantern mantle made with
thorium or small rock containing
uranium or autunite. All three
materials are radioactive.
Step 3—Put the piece of mantle
into the electroscope and charge it as before.
Step 4—Compare the amount of time it
takes to discharge the electroscope with
the radioactive material in it and without
the radioactive material. Does the thorium
radiation discharge the electroscope?
Hint: If you ionize the
air, the charge will
leak faster. Radiation
will ionize air.

Types of Radiation
Ernest Rutherford found that uranium had two types of radia-
tions. One type, which he named alpha rays, would not go
through a sheet of paper. The second kind, beta rays, was
more penetrating. One sheet of paper would stop an alpha ray,
but it took a hundred sheets to stop beta rays.
In 1900, Paul Villard of France discovered a third type of
radiation that was far more penetrating than beta rays. He called
this radiation gamma rays. We now know that these rays are
similar to radio waves, light, and microwaves. The difference
is that gamma rays have much more energy.
More work showed that alpha rays and beta rays are tiny
pieces of atoms. They are more accurately called alpha particles
and beta particles. Alpha particles are made up of two protons
and two neutrons, identical to the nuclei of helium atoms. Beta
particles are free-flying electrons.
Gamma rays are the most penetrating kind of natural radiation.
Thick concrete or lead is needed to stop them. In 1914, Rutherford
showed that gamma rays and X-rays act alike.


30 NUCLEAR SCIENCE
What Is Radiation?.
In 1903, Marie Curie pictured how radiation is bent by magnets.
The paths of alpha particles (positively charged) are bent one way,
and the paths of beta particles (negatively charged) are bent the
opposite way.
In 1903, Marie and Pierre Curie isolated a new
radioactive substance they called radium. To describe
the amount of radiation given off by any material,
scientists needed a new unit. They called it the
curie after the famous researchers. One curie (Ci)
of a radioactive substance will give off 37 billion
radiations each second, an amount equal to the
activity in 1 gram of radium. In SI units, you may
see the much-smaller becquerel (Bq) as a unit for
measuring radioactivity: 37 billion becquerel
equal 1 curie, and 1 becquerel equals 1 decay
(disintegration) per second.

Antoine Henri Becquerel (1852–1908), a French physi-
cist, experimented with phosphorescent uranium
salts to determine if they gave off X-rays. He discov-
ered instead their natural radioactivity. In 1903, he
was awarded half of the Nobel Prize in physics for his
discovery. (The other half went to Marie and Pierre
Curie.) The unit used to measure small amounts of
radioactivity is called the becquerel in his honor.
Marie Curie (1867–1934), born in Poland, became
the first European woman to receive a doctorate in
a scientific field. The first person to use the term
radioactive, Curie also ranks as the first winner of two
Nobel Prizes: in physics, in 1903, for the work she and
her husband, Pierre, did on Becquerel’s discovery; and
in chemistry, in 1911, for her discovery of the elements
polonium and radium. After years of radiation expo-
sure during research, Curie died of leukemia at age 67.
Charles Thomson Rees Wilson (1869–1959) received
the Nobel Prize in physics in 1927 “for his method
of making the paths of electrically charged particles
visible by condensation of vapour”—the expansion
cloud chamber. He was a meteorological observer
in Scotland where he tried to reproduce clouds in
his lab by expanding and
cooling air. In 1896, he fired
some newly discovered radium
through a cloud and saw it left
a trail of water droplets in the
gas. Wilson’s cloud chamber
was used for many years in
nuclear physics.
A cloud chamber is a clear-sided
vessel containing alcohol vapor
that shows the paths or tracks of
electrically charged particles
passing through. Shown here
are alpha particle tracks.

Build a Cloud Chamber
Although ionizing particles are invisible, you can use a cloud chamber to
see the tracks the particles leave behind. You can build a cloud chamber with
household items, or you can buy a kit from an educational supply store.
Materials You Will Need
q Clear polystyrene petri dish*
(available from biological supply
companies)
q Methanol or HEET™ (methyl alcohol,
available from automobile parts
stores) or propanol-2*
q Black felt strip
q Flashlight
q Tweezers
q Dry ice** (available from some grocery or ice cream stores. Buy dry ice
the morning of the demonstration in order to minimize the
sublimation losses of the dry ice. If you must buy the evening before,
store in a sealed cooler that allows the CO2 gas to vent as it sublimes
from the solid form. The loss rate of dry ice is somewhere between
5-10 pounds in 24 hours.)
q Thick leather Gloves
q Scuba-mask defogger
q Gas lantern mantle containing thorium or a small rock containing
autunite or uranium (Adults must handle these radioactive materials!)
Step 1—Spray the outside of the bottom of the petri dish black. Place a
strip of felt on the inside of the bottom rim.
Step 2—With an eye dropper, carefully add about 3 ml of methanol to
petri dish around felt rim.
Step 3—Using tweezers and with adult supervision, place small
radioactive source or rock in center of petri dish. Close dish.
*Methanol is flammable and poisonous. Keep it away from
heat and open flame. Use it in a well-ventilated area, wear
plastic gloves to protect your skin, and never drink it.


NUCLEAR SCIENCE 33
.What Is Radiation?
Step 4—Wearing thick leather gloves, place the petri dish on a cake
of dry ice. Seal the chamber and wait 10-15 minutes to allow the
supersaturated zone of alcohol to form a layer near the bottom of the
dish. Be sure the petri dish is in good contact with the dry ice.
Step 5—Expect to observe particle tracks within 10-15 minutes, though
there are cases where the tracks may appear within a few minutes,
and others where it takes longer. In some rare cases, if the saturated
zone does not form, the chamber might have to be adjusted: perhaps a
little more alcohol, a new piece of felt, and then resealed. Use a strong
flashlight well placed to shine at an angle to the petri dish. If you see
only a very thick mist and no tracks, open the petri dish and let some of
the vapor escape.
What Is Happening?
An electrically charged cosmic
particle that passes through
the cloud chamber ionizes
the alcohol vapor—that is, it
strips electrons from some
of the atoms along its path.
Removing electrons (which are
negatively charged) leaves the
atoms positively charged. This triggers condensation that reveals the
path the particle took through the chamber. The condensed droplets of
alcohol make the particle’s trail visible. Short and fat trails are from alpha
particles; fine, curly trails are beta particles; and long, straight trails are
from muons (cosmic rays). Forked tracks are from a particle decay.
**Dry ice can severely damage your skin. Never handle it
bare-handed; always wear thick gloves and eye protection.
Set the dry ice in a box or on a tray to protect your tabletop
or work surface. Dry ice changes to carbon dioxide gas, so
operate your cloud chamber in a well-ventilated area.
You can get a small radioactive source at a rock or hobby shop
or an educational supply store to place in the jar and increase the
radiation, rather than depend on natural cosmic rays.

Radioisotopes and Half-Life
Atoms that have too much energy are unstable. They give off
the extra energy to become stable. Atoms that give off energy
(radiation) are called radioisotopes.
Rutherford found that radioactive materials get less radio-
active as they get older. The radioactive nuclei change into sta-
ble (nonradioactive) nuclei as they give off radiation, a process
called radioactive decay.
Rutherford called the amount of time it takes an element to
lose one-half of its radioactivity its half-life. Half-life is the time
required for half of the unstable atoms to decay.
You can’t judge how much radiation is being produced
based on the physical size of the source. Radioactive material
with long half-lives, meaning it decays away slowly, will not
give off a lot of radiation per unit mass. This is referred to as
the isotope’s specific activity. For isotopes like cobalt-60, which
only has a half life of a few years, a gram of cobalt-60 has the
same activity (number of decays per minute) as 1800 tons of
uranium. Different radioactive elements have different half-
lives. The half-life of iodine-131 is eight days; strontium-90, 29
years; uranium-238, 4.5 billion years. Nobelium-251 has a half-
life of less than one second.
Of the 111 known
elements, there
are about 2,500
isotopes; almost
all are radioactive.
Scientists estimate
there are at least
another 1,500 yet
to be discovered.
Decay time—the time it takes for a radioactive ele-
ment to transform into a different element by giving
off particles. This decay leads to a less energetic,
more stable nucleus.

Half-Life Activity
Half-life is the statistical time it takes for an isotope
to reduce its starting quantity by half.
Start with 100 coins in a resealable bag. Each coin
represents a nucleus.
Step 1—Shake the bag and carefully put the coins
on the table. What is the chance of a flipped coin
landing on heads? (Statistically a quarter has a 50%
chance of landing on heads or tails.)
Step 2—Separate heads and tails. Count the number
of heads and write the number down.
Step 3—Set aside the tails. Put the heads back in the
bag.
Repeat all steps until there are no more coins to put
back in the bag.
Look at the numbers you wrote down. You can make
a graph on graph paper or with the coins in stacks.
What does your graph look like? Is it a straight line
or is it another shape?
Repeat this activity a few more times and compare

We use radiation in many forms, both natural and manufac-
tured, for many different purposes. From medical X-rays and
cancer treatments to investigating crimes, choosing where to
drill for oil, inspecting airline luggage, and powering scientific
instruments onboard space probes, nuclear technologies are
among our most versatile tools.
Radiation in Medicine
Radiation is used so widely for medical diagnosis and
treatment that virtually every U.S. hospital has some
form of nuclear medicine unit or radiology (X-ray)
department. Physicians use X-ray pictures of the bones
and internal organs to look for injuries and diseases,
such as broken bones or lung disease, inside a patient’s
body. Dentists use X-ray pictures to reveal cavities
and other problems in teeth. Most X-ray techniques
for imaging are known as transmission techniques
that are good for anatomical imaging. Anatomical
imaging refers to the fact that the imaging technique is
primarily intended to reveal differences in the structure
of anatomy.
X-rays are made the same way today as Roentgen made them in 1895.
Electrons are shot through a vacuum tube and, when they hit a metal
plate, X-rays are given off. X-rays are sensitive to different densities
of material so they are well suited for imaging solid structures. X-rays
come from electron’s binding energy and any other excess energy that
was imparted to the electron while being removed from its bound state.

Nuclear Medicine
Nuclear medicine uses small amounts of radioactive substances
or tracers for diagnosing various diseases. The tracers are
injected, inhaled, or swallowed; then they travel through the
body to the organ or tissue being examined. Different kinds
of tracers are taken up mainly by one organ or cell type in the
body. Radioactive iodine (iodine-131), for example, collects
in the thyroid gland. Strontium-85 is a bone seeker. Different
forms of technetium-99 are used for brain, bone, liver, and
kidney imaging.
Special cameras detect the radiation emitted by the
tracer and produce pictures or images of the organ or tissue
on a computer screen or photographic film. From the images,
physicians can see how well the organ or organ system is
working. They may also spot tumors, areas of infection, or
other problems.
Nuclear medicine can be confusing to describe since
it refers to both imaging using nuclear emissions of rays of

down your findings. Discuss why
the different parts of the image have
different levels of brightness.
In an X-ray room, the operators

material, with a leaded glass
window for observing the patient,
so they do not get radiation
exposure with every patient.

particles and therapy that uses the same or similar rays and
particles. By therapy we mean that the intention of nuclear
medicine is to destroy diseased tissues such as cancerous
tissues or to eliminate hyperactive thyroid.
Nuclear medicine techniques can use gamma rays to
image. Gamma rays do not come from electron binding
energies exchange but rather initiate from energy changes
inside of the atom’s nucleus. As nucleons change their
energetic state, gamma rays can be directly emitted from the
nucleus or other particles will be emitted from the nucleus.
Try this experiment: Ask a nuclear medicine technologist
about how much activity they inject for kidney imaging and
what the name, isotope and half-life is of the radionuclide that
is injected.
• Repeat the same questions, but this time ask for thyroid
ablation (removal of the thyroid).
• Compare the answers. Why do you think one is higher
than the other?
• Background activity in some parts of Washington, D.C.,
can be 0.3 microCuries. How many half-lives would it take for
the radionuclides above at the stated injected activity before
the activity would be the same or slightly lower as the stated
background activity in Washington?
Radiation Therapy
Radiation therapy takes on several forms. Radiation therapy, as
stated above can be from nuclear medicine approaches with
injectable isotopes or from X-ray emitting machinery.
Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation (X-rays) to
treat cancer. The radiation destroys the cancer cells’ ability to
reproduce, and the body naturally gets rid of the weakened
cells. Damage to normal body cells is minimized. Types of
cancer that often are treated with radiation therapy include
cancer of the larynx (the voice box) and prostate cancer.
For thyroid
disorders, such as
Graves’ disease,
treatment with
radioactive iodine
is so successful
that it has
virtually replaced
thyroid surgery.
Rosalyn Yalow (1921–2011) earned a doctorate in nuclear physics and,
while working at the Bronx (NY) VA Hospital, developed the Radioisotope
Service. This led to the 1950s development of radioimmunoassay (RIA),
which measures tiny quantities of hormones, viruses, etc., in the blood,
enabling doctors to detect problems such as hepatitis in blood banks.
RIA has also made possible much of today’s medical progress in diabe-
tes research. Yalow won the 1977 Nobel Prize in physiology/medicine.

Doses of radioactive materials also can be used inside
the body to treat diseases. Patients may swallow radioisotopes
or get them in shots (injections). Other times, pieces of a
radioisotope are surgically implanted. A small radioactive
source inserted into a tumor can destroy cancer cells.
Modern radiation therapy can use a collimated beam of
neutrons or accelerated charged particles such as electrons
or protons. It has been only in this century that accelerated
protons are commercially available and can be found in some
hospitals. The benefit of using accelerated charged particles
is that as they traverse tissue on their way to a tumor, the
If you break your arm and get an X-ray at the doctor’s office, does your
arm become radioactive? Maybe just for a few minutes? Objects (and
people) do not become radioactive when exposed to X-rays. Although
some of the energy of the X-ray beam is deposited in your bones and
tissues, this energy does not make your body radioactive.
A nuclear medicine technique that uses antimatter is positron
emission tomography (PET). When a short-lived positron emitter
such as oxygen-15 meets its matter counterpart, positron and
electron annihilate each other in a detectable burst of energy.
The PET image that results shows how well an organ, such as
the brain, is functioning.

Irradiated Foods
Treating foods with ionizing radiation kills harmful
bacteria and parasites that can make people sick.
Irradiation also can keep fruits and vegetables fresher
longer. It gives potatoes a longer shelf life by keeping
them from sprouting.
Three different types of ionizing radiation can be
used on foods: X-rays, streams of high-energy elec-
trons, or gamma rays. The radiation does not make
food radioactive or less nutritious. Some treated
foods may taste slightly different, just as pasteurized
milk tastes slightly different from unpasteurized milk.
Many foods can be irradiated, including meat,
poultry, grains, herbs and spices, and fresh pro-
duce. In the United States, some supermarkets
sell irradiated produce and poultry.
Irradiated foods are labeled with a symbol called the
radura—simple green petals in a broken circle. The
symbol is used worldwide to identify food that has
been irradiated. The package also will have the words
“treated by irradiation.”

centimeters below the surface of the human body.

high-energy X-ray beams or accelerated charged particle beams
is performed using computer software. Ask what types of
medical images are used to help in the planning process. Ask if,

medical images is used in the treatment plan.
Radiation in Agriculture
Radioisotopes can be used to kill pests that destroy crops.
Radioactive materials are used to preserve seeds and keep
harvested crops from spoiling. With radiation, foods like
potatoes can be preserved for long periods.

Nuclear technology methods can detect pollutants, pes-
ticides, or fertilizers hidden in plants. By showing how plants
absorb fertilizer, radioactive materials help researchers learn
when fertilizer should be applied and how much is needed.
This helps prevent the overuse of fertilizers, a major source of
soil and water pollution.
Nuclear techniques have been used to sterilize insects to
eradicate agricultural pests, like the tsetse fly in Ethiopia and
the Mediterranean fruit fly in Jordan. Another nuclear tech-
nique, isotopy hydrology, can desalinate sea water, making
more freshwater available for human use.
Radiation in Industry
Industry uses radioisotopes in developing new products and
devices. Radioisotopes have been used in devices to measure
the levels of liquid in a tank, the thickness of metals or plastics,
the wear on machine parts, or the mixing of two substances.
Radiation is used to sterilize baby powder, bandages, contact
lens solution, and many cosmetics.

Radiography lets us take a picture of the inside of things without
cutting them open. Note the broken finger in this radiograph.
X-rays also are used in industry. To check the strength of a
weld, for example, X-rays are aimed at the weld with a film on
the opposite side. Any dark place in the film shows a weak-
ness in the weld. If no dark spots show up, the weld is OK.
This technique of taking pictures (radiographs) with
X-rays is a versatile and reliable method of inspection to
determine a material’s strength or to check for flaws. It lets
inspectors see inside materials without taking them apart.

Radiation in Art History
Art historians use radiation techniques for detailed analy-
sis and preservation for paintings. They use photon, X-ray
and neutron beams produced by particle accelerators and
research reactors to scan paint samples or entire paint-
ings to learn more about their composition, manufacturing
methods and history.

money, but this was a significant discovery.
Irradiated Gemstones
Some gemstones are exposed to radiation to change their color.
In the early 1900s scientists like Bordas and Crookes used radi-
um salts to change blue sapphires and diamonds green. Now
scientists use gamma rays from cobalt and put the gems in a
closed, heavily shielded container and leave them there until
they change color or they use a research reactor or particle
accelerator. The radiation causes electrons to be knocked off
some atoms, leaving them free to be absorbed by others. They
call this creating a “color center” which changes how light is
absorbed into the gem. The resulting gemstones are not radio-
active and they are safe to wear.
Typically yellow, topaz
becomes blue after
irradiation.
Smoke Detectors
A common type of smoke detector uses a radioisotope to make a
stream of alpha particles. Alpha particles ionize smoke particles when
they enter the detector. When the detector senses ionized smoke
particles, it sounds the alarm. Because alpha particles can travel only a
short distance in air, having a smoke detector in
your home gives you virtually no radiation.
Smoke detectors use alpha particles
within a chamber to ionize the air
between two conducting plates.
When smoke enters the air in the
chamber, the conductance of the
air between the two plates is
decreased, and the current is
affected. This change in current
causes the alarm to go off.
A smoke detector is one example of the
beneficial use of radiation. With the cover off,
you can see the protective container holding
the radioactive americium source. (Note: Never open
the radioactive source container in a smoke detector.)

Radiation in Science
The uses of radiation in science and research are many and
varied. Here are a few examples to consider.
Radiocarbon Dating
All living things have some radioactive carbon-14 in them.
Because living things no longer take in carbon-14 when they
die, we can measure the amount left in substances that once
were living, such as wood, and figure out when the living thing
died. Archaeologists and paleontologists use this measurement
in their studies.
This technique, called radiocarbon dating, also is used
in environmental studies to learn how Earth’s climate has
changed in the past and to help researchers predict how the
global climate might change in the future. The carbon-14
technique is an essential tool in many fields including
atmospheric science, oceanography, geology, and climatology.
Space Exploration
The Mars rover Sojourner used alpha particles to identify
chemical elements in Martian rocks. An instrument on the
rover bombarded selected rocks
with alpha particles, then read
the X-rays generated from the
rocks. Because each chemical
element produces a distinctive
X-ray, the instrument could
determine the composition of
the rocks.
On many spacecraft,
heat produced by the natural
radioactive decay of plutonium
(a metallic, heavy element)
is converted to electricity to
power the craft’s onboard
scientific instruments. This type
of electrical power supply has
been used in several U.S. space
missions including Viking to
Mars, Voyager and Pioneer to the
outer planets, Galileo to Jupiter,
and Cassini to Saturn.
NASA’s Mars rover Sojourner spent 83 days of a
planned seven-day mission exploring the Martian
terrain in 1997, acquiring images, and taking chemical,
atmospheric, and other measurements.

Radiation exposure during spaceflight is a serious threat
to an astronaut’s health. The radiation environment outside of
Earth’s protective atmosphere is comprised of energetic protons
and heavy nuclei that pose a hazard to living organisms. NASA’s
Space Radiation Element is working to characterize health out-
comes associated with space radiation exposure so that they can
protect astronaut health and ensure safe human spaceflight.
Neutron Activation
Shooting neutrons into stable atomic nuclei can make them
radioactive, a process called neutron activation. When nuclei
are activated, they get rid of the extra energy by giving off a
beta particle or gamma ray.
Gamma rays are not all alike. Some have more energy than
others. The gamma ray given off from neutron activation of a
calcium nucleus is different from a gamma ray given off from
neutron activation of a gold nucleus. By looking for the gamma
ray or beta particle that comes off from a sample, a scientist
can tell which elements are in the sample. Neutron activation
analysis is a valuable tool for a scientist to identify materials
in the laboratory.
Elements can be identified by the radiation
“fingerprint” they give off. (Atoms can be drawn
in many ways. This pamphlet uses the form shown
here, a circle with the symbol of the element, mass
number, and atomic number. Electrons may or may
not be shown. Electrons do not play an active part in

in a gallon of water, you couldn’t taste the salt. But
neutron activation analysis could find it.
Neutron activation allows
scientists to measure the
pollution that was in the

tree was alive and growing.
Neutron activation analysis is used, for example, for detect-
ing arsenic that may get into fish we eat, or for finding which
elements are in the coal burned for electric power. We can
discover heavy metals in sewage to prevent releasing pollutants
into our environment. Ecologists can follow the movement of
tiny amounts of insecticides in the environment.

Fission and Fusion:
Nuclear Energy
Almost everyone has heard of Albert Einstein’s famous equation,
E = mc2. The equation is a short way of saying that matter can
be changed to energy. To find out how much energy (E) you get
from a mass of matter (m), you multiply by the speed of light
squared (c2).
In the early 20th century, however, Einstein’s equation was
not fully verified. No one yet knew how to convert mass to
energy. The ideas and work of many other scientists would be
needed to show how to do it.

Neutrons as Atomic Bullets
By the 1930s, new discoveries were leading researchers in
promising new directions. After James Chadwick discovered the
neutron in 1932, scientists began shooting neutrons like bullets
into atomic nuclei. The results of these collisions told researchers
much about the properties of the nuclei.
Two things can happen to an atom hit by a neutron. One
possibility is that it will add one unit to the atom’s mass number.
When a neutron is added to the nucleus, the atomic number
stays the same; only the mass number is changed.
Sometimes, the neutron breaks down as it hits an atom.
The breakdown produces a proton, which remains in the
nucleus, and an electron (a beta particle), which flies out.
The second thing, therefore, that can happen to a nucleus when
a neutron hits it is that it will give off a beta particle and the nucleus
will now have one more proton than before. This adds one unit to
the atomic number. If the atom gives off a beta particle after catching
a neutron, one unit will be added to the mass number and one unit
Albert Einstein (1879–1955), born in Germany, became
interested in physics as a child playing with his father’s
compass. In 1905 at age 26, Einstein earned a doctorate
and published four groundbreaking theories. His theory
that light exists in “packets,” or photons, won him a 1921
Nobel Prize. His special theory of relativity added time as
a fourth dimension and controversially claimed that time and distance are
relative to the observer. He also published his famous equation, E = mc2,
which explains that matter and energy are different forms of the same thing.
At the end of his life, Einstein tried to create a unified field theory that would
link together everything from subatomic particles to the universe as a whole.
Today, some physicists still pursue Einstein’s vision of a unified theory.

will be added to the atomic number, changing the
atom into a new element. Enrico Fermi found that
if you shoot an atom with a neutron, when the
beta particle comes out, the atom always changes
into the next heavier element.
What if you hit the heaviest known element,
uranium, with a neutron? You could make a new,
even heavier element. Fermi tried it. The uranium
(element 92) disappeared, but no new element
93 could be found. Where did it go? What was
going on?
Splitting the Atom
In 1934, Fermi was trying to make element 93.
When he shot neutrons into uranium, he got beta
particles, as he expected. But when he tested for
atoms of element 93, none were found.
In Germany, Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner
worked on Fermi’s problem. In 1938, Meitner left
Germany because of political oppression. Fritz
Strassmann joined Hahn, and they kept working.
They continued shooting neutrons into uranium
and looking for a new element about as heavy
as uranium.
What they did find looked like barium. But uranium atoms
have an atomic mass of around 238. The new element should be
about the same mass. Barium is far too light, with a mass of 137.
For uranium to change to barium, the uranium nucleus would
have to break into large pieces.
Enrico Fermi (1901–1954) was born in Italy and came to
the United States to teach. He won the 1938 Nobel Prize
in physics for discovering nuclear reactions set off by
neutrons. In 1942, on a squash court at the University
of Chicago, he conducted an experiment that led to
the first controlled nuclear reaction and the start of the
Atomic Age. Fermi became a leader among the physicists who worked
on the Manhattan Project, the name given to the project created by the
U.S. government in 1942 to develop the atomic bomb.
By adding a proton, elements can
be changed into different elements.
The transformation of one element
into another by a nuclear reaction
is called transmutation.

Lise Meitner (1878–1968) of Austria codiscovered the 91st
element, protactinium, with Otto Hahn in Berlin in 1918.
Her continued work with Hahn (and another scientist,
Fritz Strassmann) led to the 1938 discovery of nuclear
fission, the process by which an atom splits, releasing
tremendous amounts of energy. Fission was later used
in World War II to produce the atomic bomb, but Meitner
refused to contribute to the creation of nuclear weapons.
Element 109 was named meitnerium in her honor.
Otto Hahn (1879–1968) of Germany received a doctorate
in chemistry and, working under Ernest Rutherford,
discovered a new radioactive substance called radio-
actinium. In 1907, he began 30 years of research with
Lise Meitner. Their work, with that of Fritz Strassmann,
led to the discovery of nuclear fission, which won Hahn
the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry. Element 105 was
named hahnium in his honor.
Ernest Lawrence (1901–1958), born in South Dakota,
taught physics at Yale, then took a job at the University
of California at Berkeley. He invented the cyclotron, a
circular type of particle accelerator that speeds up nuclear
particles. This device later was used in cancer treatments
and won him the 1939 Nobel Prize in physics. Lawrence
made important contributions to the Manhattan Project,
but he later discouraged atomic bomb testing. Element
103 was named lawrencium in his honor.
Glenn T. Seaborg (1912–1999), born in Michigan, earned
a doctorate in chemistry and taught at the University of
California at Berkeley. Seaborg codiscovered plutonium,
the element used to fuel some nuclear reactors and to
make nuclear weapons. In 1951, the former Scout won
the Nobel Prize for understanding the chemistry of
plutonium and the nearby elements. With colleagues, he
identified 10 new elements and more than 100 isotopes
of different elements. From 1942 to 1946, he headed the
Manhattan Project’s plutonium research. Element 106
was named seaborgium in his honor.


52 NUCLEAR SCIENCE
Fission and Fusion: Nuclear Energy.
Hahn and Strassmann wrote to Lise Meitner about their
research. She concluded that when uranium is hit with a neutron,
it must break in half. Dr. Meitner co-wrote a paper on this idea in
1939. An American biologist, William Arnold, read the paper and
decided to call the splitting of atoms fission—the word biologists
used for the splitting of cells.
Chain Reaction
Fission would not be useful for producing energy if we had to
shoot each nucleus with a neutron to break it. That would use
more energy than it would produce.
But each fission releases extra neutrons. These neutrons
can be used to split other nuclei.
Fermi found that with the element he was using—
uranium—slow neutrons hit nuclei better than fast ones
did. Fermi used moderators to slow down the neutrons.
In December 1942, Fermi and a group of other scientists
completed the first atomic pile. This was a stack of blocks of
graphite containing uranium in carefully spaced lumps. The
graphite was the moderator. Rods of cadmium in the pile soaked
up neutrons before they could hit the uranium. These control
rods kept the reaction from starting. Then, when the experiment
ended, the rods would be used to stop the reaction.
Slowly, one by one, the rods were pulled out. The reaction
started and then went faster and faster. The chain reaction was
continuing on its own. Neutrons from one fission were causing
more fissions. The world had entered the nuclear age.
The stack of blocks Fermi used was called a nuclear
pile. Modern devices for hosting chain reactions are
called nuclear reactors. A critical mass of nuclear fuel
is necessary to sustain a chain reaction. Too little fuel
produces too few neutrons to keep the fissions going.

Diagram Nuclear Fission
Your drawing of nuclear fission should show the
incoming neutron, the nucleus it hits, the nucleus
splitting, and what is released: fission fragments,
neutrons, and lots of energy.
The fission process changes mass to energy
consistent with Einstein’s equation (page 48). The
neutron and the target nucleus have more mass
than the fission fragments and free neutrons. Fission
converts about 3 millionths of an attogram (0.000
0000 000 000 000 000 000 000 03 grams) to energy.
The lost mass is also called the mass defect.

Make a Mousetrap Reactor
In this fun experiment, you can watch a demonstration
of a chain reaction to show how nuclear fission works.
Materials You Will Need
q Transparent plastic box
q Knife or scissors
q 20 (or more) spring mousetraps
q 20 (or more) pingpong balls
q Gloves
Step 1—Carefully cut a small hole in one edge of
the bottom of the plastic box, large enough for a
pingpong ball to fit through easily.
Step 2—Place the lid of the box on a flat surface.
Put all mousetraps in lines, covering the entire lid
with traps. Ask an adult to carefully set the traps.
Step 3—Have an adult gently place a pingpong ball
on each mousetrap. Don’t set off any traps! See the
photo in the upper left corner
of the cover of this pamphlet.
Step 4—The adult can then
place the box bottom on top
of the lid. This contains the
reaction and protects anyone
from being hit by a ball.
Step 5—Drop a pingpong
ball into the box through
the top hole of the reactor
chamber. Watch quickly! It lasts only a few seconds.
How It Works
Critical System—Each mousetrap represents a
nucleus of U-235. A free neutron (the additional
pingpong ball put into the box) initiates a chain
reaction and fissions a U-235 nucleus by triggering
a mousetrap. More neutrons (pingpong balls) are
released and they fission other neutrons.
Working with
mousetraps can
be tricky. Some
mousetraps are
sensitive and
can snap on your
fingers. Gloves
may help. Set the
traps carefully.

Modern Nuclear Reactors
Today’s nuclear reactors look much different from Fermi’s
pile of graphite, uranium, and cadmium, but the principles on
which they work are the same. Reactors are used to produce
and control nuclear energy. The energy released by splitting
nuclei creates large amounts of heat. This heat can be used to
make steam, and the steam spins turbines to generate electricity.
The reactor’s core contains rods of nuclear fuel inside
a tanklike structure called the reactor vessel. Control rods
containing neutron-absorbing materials such as cadmium are
pushed into the core or pulled out to slow down or speed up
the chain reaction. The control rods also are part of the safety
systems that prevent the chain reaction from going too fast.
The moderator fills the spaces between the fuel rods. Most
of today’s nuclear reactors use water as a moderator.
Water also works to cool the core. It carries off the heat
made by the chain reaction, transferring it to where it can be
used to generate electricity. Water, therefore, is both a modera-
tor and a coolant.
The energy in one uranium fuel pellet—the
size of the tip of your little finger—equals
the energy in 17,000 cubic feet of natural
gas; 1,780 pounds of coal; or 149 gallons
of oil. In American reactors the fissionable
fuel is uranium-235 (U-235), a scarce iso-
tope of uranium. U-235 is the only natural
material that nuclear reactors can use to
produce a chain reaction. Nuclei of the
much more abundant U-238 isotope usu-
ally absorb neutrons without splitting.
A fuel rod consists of pellets of
fuel inside a metal tube. Each
of these uranium pellets has
nearly the same energy as a
ton of coal.
Subcritical System—Place a few mousetraps with
pingpong balls far apart in the box. One mousetrap
should be directly beneath the hole, so at least
one mousetrap will set off. It may take some
experimentation to figure out what the critical mass
for mousetraps is for your reactor.

Nuclear energy
is energy released
when the nucleus
of an atom splits
(fission), joins with
another nucleus
(fusion), or
disintegrates
(radiation). “Nuclear
energy” rather than
“atomic energy”
is the most exact
name for the
energy produced in
a nuclear reactor.
Kinds of Reactors
All commercial power reactors in the United States are light
water reactors. They use light (ordinary) water as the moderator
and coolant. Canadian reactors are heavy water reactors.
They use heavy water, which has deuterium in place of
ordinary hydrogen.
The two types of light water reactors are boiling water
reactors and pressurized water reactors. The boiling water type
boils the moderator water in the core, making steam inside
the reactor vessel. Pipes carry the steam to the power plant’s
turbines and generators.
Most nuclear plants in the United States use pressurized
water reactors (PWRs). This type makes steam outside the

reactor vessel. The water in the core is heated under extremely
high pressure, which allows the water to heat without boiling
far past its normal boiling point of 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
Pipes carry this extremely hot water to steam generators
outside the reactor. The steam generators transfer heat from the
pressurized water to a separate supply of water, which boils
and produces steam.
Advanced Nuclear Reactors
New reactor technologies are in development that could offer
safer, cheaper, emission-free electricity and heat for industrial
processes. There are three types:
Advanced water-cooled reactors are similar to traditional
reactors, but are designed to be simpler and much smaller.
The smaller size and power could be used in rural areas as an
emergency backup. One example are small modular reactors
(SMRs), which use a modular assembly for more efficient
construction. The power capacity is up to 300 MW per unit,
about a third of a typical power reactor. Microreactors are tiny
SMRs designed to generate electrical power up to 10 MW.
Non water-cooled reactors generate energy from
fission using coolants other than water to control the reactor
temperature. Molten salt reactors (MSRs) use a molten fluoride
salt. Other coolants being studied use liquid sodium, molten
lead or helium gas.
Fusion reactors use nuclear fusion instead of fission.
Coolants may include water and helium.
Radioactive Wastes
The fissioning of uranium-235 produces many radioactive
isotopes, such as strontium-90, cesium-137, and barium-140.
An especially dangerous nuclear-reactor byproduct is plutoni-
um-239. Plutonium remains radioactive for thousands of years,
and even in small amounts it can cause cancer.
Safely disposing of these radioactive wastes is a major issue
in nuclear power. The current plan in the United States calls for
depositing long-lived radioactive waste underground. In the
meantime, nuclear power plants in the United States store used
fuel and other wastes in pools of water at the plants.

Reactor Safety
Nuclear power plants in the United States have emergency
safety systems and backup systems that work automatically
and immediately. Built-in sensors watch temperature, pressure,
and water level. The sensors connect to systems that adjust or
shut down the reactor if something is not working right. If cool-
ing water leaks away, emergency cooling systems make up the
water loss and keep the reactor from overheating.
Plants have physical barriers to keep radiation from
escaping into the environment. Most of the radioactive
by-products of the fission process remain locked inside the
nuclear fuel pellets. The pellets are sealed inside strong metal
rods. The fuel rod assemblies are enclosed in a steel reactor
vessel with walls about 8 inches thick. The reactor vessel itself
is in a massive, reinforced steel and concrete structure called
the containment, with walls about 4 feet thick.
Nuclear power supplies about 20 percent
(one-fifth) of the electricity used in the
United States. Unlike fossil fuels (coal,
oil, and gas) burned to make electricity,
nuclear power does not produce green-
house gases—carbon dioxide and other
gases that trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere
much as a glass greenhouse captures
sunlight. Nuclear plants do not release
solid pollutants such as coal ash and
sulphur. However, used nuclear fuel
produces dangerous radiation long
after the end of its useful life. This
radioactive waste must be safely stored
and disposed of.

Nuclear Reactors as Factories
Besides generating electric power, a nuclear reactor also can
be a kind of factory for making things radioactive. Most
radioactive materials used commercially are made in nuclear
reactors or cyclotrons. For example, hitting stable cobalt
with neutrons in a reactor transforms the cobalt into a
radioisotope—cobalt-60—that has been used to treat cancer
and to sterilize medical supplies and consumer products.
Usually only one type of radioactive material can be pro-
duced at a time in a cyclotron, but a reactor can produce many
different radioisotopes at once. After the materials are made,
they are packaged and shipped to users nationwide, including
hospitals, laboratories, universities, and manufacturing plants.

Fission and Fusion: Nuclear Energy.
Fusion Research
Fission splits nuclei; fusion combines them. This process releases
tremendous amounts of energy. While fission reactors split
heavy elements like uranium, fusion reactors join light elements
(typically deuterium and tritium, isotopes of hydrogen). When
fusion occurs, the mass of the particles after the reaction is less
than the mass before the reaction. As with fission, this mass lost
in the reaction is converted to energy according to Einstein’s
equation (see pages 48 and 49).
For fusion to happen, a reactor system must create and hold
plasma, a very hot body of gas. Atoms in a plasma move so fast
they ionize, separating the electrons from the nuclei. Creating a
plasma and starting fusion requires putting a lot of energy into the
system. Because nuclei are all positively charged, there must be
enough particle energy to overcome their tendency to repel each
other. This resistance is called the coulomb barrier.
As of February 2023, the United States had 92 nuclear power plants with 95
operating nuclear reactors. (Some plants have more than one reactor in operation.)

There are three conditions for fusion to occur:
1. The plasma must be hot enough;
2. The plasma must be held in a confined space; and
3. The plasma must be held for a sufficient period of time.

Several projects around the world are trying to make fusion
possible. These include the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in
Livermore, Calif. To become a useful technology, these projects
are trying to create systems that reach ignition, producing more
energy than they use.
The NIF uses an approach called inertial confinement, a
process in which 192 powerful lasers compress a tiny fuel pellet
about the size of a grain of sand. The mighty blast of the lasers
crushes the fuel to achieve fusion. In 2022, the NIF achieved
fusion ignition—creating more energy from fusion reactions than
the energy used to start the process—for the first time anywhere.
Fusion power plants could produce a tremendous amount
of usable energy with little impact on the environment.
However, going from scientific experiments to building fusion
power plants will take additional engineering and construction.

Health Physics
Ionizing radiation can be dangerous to living things precisely
because it is ionizing—it strips electrons from atoms. An ion-
ized molecule can then chemically react with other molecules
to form new compounds. These ionized molecules and new
compounds can alter the vital processes and functions inside
a living thing.
Ionizing radiation can damage any living tissue in the
human body. The body tries to repair the damage, but the
natural repair process may fail if the damage is too severe
or widespread.
Chronic Health Effects
Exposure to low levels of radiation over a long time can cause
chronic effects, which are difficult to measure and can appear
to be unpredictable. Because radiation affects different people
differently, some effects of exposure occur randomly and do not
always depend on the size of a dose. Typical low-level exposure
(from background radiation and medical diagnostics) appears to
produce few or no adverse effects. All that can be said for sure
is that the greater a person’s radiation exposure, the more likely
that person is to develop health problems like cancer.
Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells. Normally, natu-
ral processes control the rate at which cells grow and replace
themselves. Ionizing radiation can disrupt the natural controls,
allowing runaway cell growth. This is why ionizing radiation’s
ability to strip away electrons and break chemical bonds
in atoms and molecules makes it such a potent carcinogen
(cancer producer).
Radiation also can make changes in DNA, the “blueprints”
that cells follow as they repair and copy themselves. Changes
in DNA are called mutations. Generally (but not always),
mutations are harmful, and they may be passed on to new
cells that are made when the damaged cell divides.
The effects of
radiation on
human health fall
into two general
categories:
chronic and
acute.


NUCLEAR SCIENCE 63
.Health Physics
Acute Health Effects
An acute exposure—that is, getting a big dose of radiation in
a short time—produces acute effects because they can be
predicted with certainty (determined) from what has happened
in the past to people exposed to bursts of intense radiation.
Unlike cancer, which can take years to show up, health
problems from acute exposure usually appear quickly. Acute
effects include burns and radiation sickness.
How can radiation both cure cancer and cause cancer?
Radiation affects the body by depositing energy into cells and into
molecules that make up cells. If a lot of energy (a high-radiation dose) is
deposited, the cell is killed and cannot go on to reproduce a cancerous
group of cells. If a smaller (sub-lethal) dose is deposited, the cell might
just be damaged and might eventually cause cancer. (The cell might also
be able to repair itself, in which case no damage or cancer will occur.)
Thus, a very large dose may be used to destroy most or all of the cells in
a tumor. A much smaller dose may just damage cells, and these might
later become cancerous.
What is the cancer risk from radiation?
Health physicists estimate that, if each person in a group of 10,000
people is exposed to 1 rem of ionizing radiation (see “Radiation Units”
later in this chapter), in small doses over a lifetime, we would expect
five or six more people to die of cancer than would otherwise. The
overall age-adjusted mortality rate of cancer in the U.S. was 161 per
100,000, based on a 2012−2016 study by the National Cancer Institute. A
2014−2016 study by the institute found that approximately 39.3 percent
of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime.
In the same group of 10,000 people, we would expect
• 40 to die from falling
• 40 to die in an auto accident
• 16 to die from being hit by a car
• 9 to die by drowning
• 9 to die in fires
• 2–3 to die in plane crashes
• 425 to die from some type of injury

Radiation sickness (or radiation poisoning) can be fatal.
The symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, hair loss,
skin burns, and bleeding. A person who receives a lethal dose of
radiation may die within hours or days, depending on the size
of the dose. Common treatments for radiation sickness include
blood transfusions and using antibiotics to fight infection. In
some cases, a bone marrow transplant can be lifesaving.
Our Bodies are Resilient
The cells in our body live in a continuing barrage of damaging
events. About every 10 seconds, each cell in our body “takes a
hit.” The vast majority of these assaults is not from radiation
but from inescapable byproducts of the chemical processes in
our bodies that enable us to live. Behind that is the natural or
man-made toxins that we take into our body.
Way below those effects are the five or so DNA breaks per
cell each year that happen because of background radiation.
(out of the tens of millions total). Our bodies have extremely
efficient DNA repair mechanisms.
When cells are dividing (undergoing mitosis) they are
more susceptible to radiation damage because the cells don’t
have all their repair mechanisms. Because of this, cells that are
often dividing—like the cells that create our blood or line our
intestine, hair follicles, and fetal cells—are more susceptible
to radiation damage. Specialized or slowly dividing cells, like
brain cells, are radio-insensitive.
At low doses, no physical effects have been observed.
Although somewhat controversial, this increased risk of cancer
is presumed to be proportional to the dose (no matter how
small). While radiation is a carcinogen and a mutagen, radia-
tion is a very weak carcinogen and a mutagen.
One measure of
radiation exposure
is known as a rem.

100 Radiation sickness
200 Radiation sickness with worse
symptoms in less time
400 Death probable within 2 months*
600 Death probable within 1 to 2 weeks*
*One-half of any group of people exposed to a single quick dose of
400 rem likely will die within 60 days. A single quick dose of 600 rem or
more usually causes death within a week, although people have survived
doses up to 800 rem.

Radiation Units
Radiation is measured in several different units. The roentgen (R) is for
measuring the ionizing ability of X-rays or gamma rays in air. The unit
was named for Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen, who discovered X-rays.
Different kinds of ionizing radiations have different effects on
humans. The rem (roentgen equivalent, man) measures the intensity of
the radiation, the type of the radiation, and its effect on the body. The
rem is used for health and safety purposes, describing the biological
effect of radiation on people. One rem is
approximately the dose from any radiation
corresponding to exposure to one roent-
gen of gamma radiation.
The International System unit (see the
chart) for measuring the biological danger
of radiation is the sievert (Sv). One sievert
equals 100 rem.
To describe the quantity of radiation physically absorbed by
some material, the unit used is the rad (radiation absorbed dose). The
International System unit for absorbed dose is the gray (Gy). One gray
equals 100 rad.
Converting Radiation Units
Just as the meter may be used instead of the foot, or the liter instead of the
quart, another set of radiation units may be used, called the International
System (SI). This table shows how to convert one system to the other.
If one rem is divided
into 1,000 equal
parts, each part is
one millirem (mrem).

Radiation Hazards to Wildlife
Although we know much about the dangers of radiation to
humans, its effects on wildlife are less understood. Scientists
have tended to assume that as long as people were protected,
animals and plants would be, too.
But that idea is changing, and more research is now being
done to learn how best to safeguard wildlife. Many researchers
are focusing on how wild plants and animals have been affected
by the radioactivity released from the exploded nuclear reactor
at Chernobyl. For example, some researchers are finding that
worms in a nearby lake are changing their behavior in ways
that may help protect them from radiation damage.
Radiation Contamination
A person exposed to radiation does not become radioactive.
When you get an X-ray at the doctor’s office, it does not make
you radioactive.
Getting radiation exposure is just like going to the beach
and being exposed to sunshine. The light rays may deposit
enough energy into your body to cause an effect, like a
sunburn, but when you turn off
the lights that night you will not be
glowing.
Contamination is radioactive
material spilled somewhere you
don’t want it. For example it can
be the spilled vial of a radioactive
liquid of radiopharmaceutical
pictured above, or it can be dust or
even chunks of radioactive material
wherever it is not wanted.
Even when spread around the radioactive material, the
contamination still emits radiation.
• Contamination can get on you.
• If you walk through it, touch it, or breath airborne
contamination; it may get on, or inside of you.
• The contamination might be too small to be visible.

The Chernobyl Nuclear Accident
In April 1986, operators at the Chernobyl power plant in Ukraine, in
southeastern Europe, were conducting a test of a nuclear reactor, in
which several safety systems and processes were bypassed. Conditions
to conduct the test were not as planned, but they proceeded anyway,
and the reactor exploded, releasing a cloud of radiation. Killed at once
were 31 people, mostly firefighters responding to the emergency.
About 200 people suffered acute radiation poisoning. High radiation
levels within 20 miles of the plant forced the evacuation of some
150,000 people.
For millions of people exposed to radioactive fallout from Chernobyl,
the long-term health effects are uncertain. At least 2,000 children and
young adults in the most severely contaminated areas got cancer of the
thyroid. Other forms of cancer also may be on the rise.
The explosion spread radioactive
contamination across a large area,
particularly in Belarus, Russia,
and Ukraine. Some land is so
contaminated that it can no longer
be farmed. In grazing animals such
as cattle and goats, radioactivity has
built up in the meat and milk.
Wildlife in the forests also is contaminated from feeding on radio-
active lichens and berries. Predators such as wolves and foxes are more
contaminated than the grazing animals they eat, because the radio-
activity from their prey concentrates in their bodies.
Unlike most nuclear reactors
in the West, the Chernobyl
reactor had no enclosure to
prevent radioactive materials
from escaping.

Radiation Hazards to the Environment
The environment is as big as the planet (bigger, when you
include the atmosphere extending more than 60 miles overhead),
so for requirement 1(b) you may want to focus on a specific
environmental issue such as radioactive waste. Radioactive
wastes produced by nuclear reactors, research, and medical
laboratories pose a potentially serious environmental problem.
The safe and permanent disposal of radioactive waste
is difficult and expensive. A storage site for nuclear waste
must be in an area without earthquakes or weaknesses in the
ground. The site must be dry so that containers of waste will
not rust or corrode and leak into underground water supplies.
The site must be built and protected so that future generations
do not accidentally dig into it and release radioactivity.
Radiation Detectors
Using our normal senses, people cannot detect radiation. You
cannot hear, smell, see, taste, or feel it. So how do we know
it’s there? How do we protect ourselves from it?
Many types of radiation detectors are in use. You have
learned that radiation makes changes in photographic film
and will create ions in matter through which it passes. One way
to detect radiation, therefore, is to wrap pieces of film in dark
paper and put them in holders or badges that people wear on
their clothes. When radiation passes through the dark paper and
hits the film beneath, it darkens the film. The darker the film,
the more radiation the person has received.
Another example is an easy-to-carry radiation
monitor called the thermoluminescent dosimeter
(TLD). This monitor contains a small crystal of a
substance (like lithium fluoride) that absorbs energy
when hit by radiation. When the crystal is removed
and heated, it will glow. The more energy the
crystal received from radiation, the more it will
glow when heated.
Many types of
radiation detectors
are in use. Your
counselor can
probably discuss
some of the other
types with you.
Dosimeters—devices such as film badges, TLD badges,
or pocket ionization chambers—measure the doses of
radiation a person has received.


NUCLEAR SCIENCE 69
.Health Physics
A radiation detector that most people
have heard of is the Geiger counter. Basically,
this instrument counts radiation as it passes
through a gas-filled tube and makes ions in
the gas. If the instrument has a speaker,
you hear a click each time radiation
passes through. The more clicks, the
more radiation is being detected.
A Geiger counter clicks as it counts ions created
when radiation passes through the instrument’s
gas-filled tube. Faster clicks mean higher radiation.
Use a Radiation Survey Meter
Most emergency response groups, such as fire departments and
ambulances, have radiation detectors that you might be able to use
for this activity. You also could check with nearby colleges, physics labs,
or even high schools.
Different types of radiation survey meters are used to detect
different types and energies of radiation.
• Ionization (ion) chambers. Used mainly to determine the exposure
rate from gamma ray and X-ray emitters, ion chambers are particu-
larly useful for measuring machine-produced X-rays.
• Geiger-Müller (GM) detectors. Easy-to-use, portable GM detectors
(familiar to most people as Geiger counters) are good for many types
of radiation surveys. They are most efficient for detecting high-energy
beta emitters such as phosphorus-32, but they can be used to measure
low-energy beta emitters such as carbon-14.
• Scintillation detectors. Scintillation detectors are used to detect
gamma radiation and they are much more sensitive to gamma and
X-rays than are GM detectors. They may have an audible output like
GM detectors.

Natural Background Radiation and NORM
Like sunlight, ionizing radiation is a natural part of our envi-
ronment. Radiation exists all around us in nature. Soil, rocks,
air, food, water, and even your body contain radioactive sub-
stances. Radioactive carbon-14 is in all the food we eat. Cosmic
rays fall on us from space. Most Americans get about 300 mil-
lirem (mrem) each year from natural radiation sources.
We call these Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material, or
NORM. Although almost all materials have very small quanti-
ties of naturally occurring radioactive materials, they are not
usually considered to be “radioactive.” The quantity of radio-
activity is so small that you would need a special sensitive
radiation detector in order to measure it. Bananas are high in
potassium and contain potassium-40, a radioactive isotope.
Other common foods containing potassium include carrots
and white potatoes and lima beans (which also contain radon-
224). Radioactive carbon-14 is in all the food we eat. The most
radioactive food item is the Brazil nut, containing radium. In
all these foods, the amount of radiation levels are extremely
low, and almost none of the radioactive material is retained in
the body. Most Americans get about 300 millirem (mrem) each
year from natural radiation sources. The ingested dose for an
average banana is about 0.01 mrem.
For a radiation source, you might use an old radium-dial watch, a thorium-
containing incandescent lantern mantle, or a piece of vintage red-orange din-
nerware. Almost any antique ceramic in a deep orange or red color is likely to
be slightly radioactive because manufacturers once used uranium to produce
ceramic glazes. A good Geiger counter can detect the radiation in potash, in
very low-sodium salt, or in any high-
potassium fertilizer. You will not be able
to detect the radiation from a smoke
detector.
Your counselor or other
qualified adult will show
you how to properly use a
radiation survey meter. When
monitoring for low-energy
beta emitters with a GM
survey meter, you must pass
the detector slowly across
and very close to the surface
you are checking.

Cosmic Rays
The sun and other stars give off radiation that we call cosmic rays. The
average exposure in the United States from this source is 30 mrem per
year. Earth’s atmosphere provides a good deal of shielding from cosmic
rays. The higher the elevation at which you live, the closer you are to
space and the more cosmic radiation you receive. People in Denver, one
of the higher cities in the United States, may get 50 mrem each year.
Airliners fly at high altitudes; flight crews might receive an additional
dose of from 100-200 mrem per year.
Test for Radon Indoors
Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas. It is produced by the
radioactive decay of radium, an element found in soil and rocks in all
parts of the United States.
Colorless and odorless, radon gas may seep indoors unnoticed from
the soil and rocks beneath buildings. It can enter homes through drains
or cracks in the foundation. In some areas that have a lot of radon in the
ground, the gas may build up indoors to unhealthy levels.
As radon decays, it gives off radiation in the form of alpha particles
that can damage cells in the body, leading to cancer. By some estimates,
radon causes about 20,000 deaths from lung cancer each year in the U.S.
The average U.S. radiation exposure from radon gas in the air is 200
mrem (a figure that can vary greatly, depending on actual levels of radon
in the ground where you live and the construc-
tion/ventilation properties of the building).
Test kits are available for people to check the
radon levels in their homes. The Environmental
Protection Agency recommends taking action to
reduce radon if the radioactivity from this gas is
more than 4 picocuries per liter of air (4 pCi/L). The EPA estimates that 6
percent of U.S. homes exceed 4 pCi/L.
It is fairly simple to test the radon level in your home. Many kinds
of low-cost, do-it-yourself radon test kits are available through the mail
and in hardware stores and other kinds of stores. Find information (with
your parent or guardian’s permission) online at epa.gov/radon, or call the
National Radon Hotline toll-free at 800-SOS-RADON (800-767-7236) to
order by phone. To speak with an information specialist, call the National
Radon Helpline toll-free at 1-800-55RADON (800-557-2366).

Cosmic rays fall on us from space. Another major
source of background radiation is from Earth itself. Earth
contains potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232, which
have long half-lives. Shorter half-lived species from the decay
of the radioactive ores in the earth can cause a hazard, like
radon-222 gas.
Since the human body is made up of the same elements
as the environment around us, a small percentage of those
atoms are radioactive. The most common are carbon-14 and
potassium-40. Living organisms like trees, plants, people, and
animals contain carbon-14. Potassium is a key part of DNA.
Scientists use the presence of carbon-14 to do radiocarbon
dating. When a living organism dies, the amount of carbon in
a carcass matches that of the atmosphere at the time of death.
By measuring the carbon-14 decays, scientists can calculate
the age of the plant or animal. The age of a sample up to
around 60,000 years can be fairly accurately determined. The
method now uses a particle accelerator technique called an
accelerator mass spectrometer. Carbon dating has been used in
archaeology, history and geology.
Would it surprise
you to know that
your home may
be radioactive? If
your house is
constructed from
brick, concrete,
stone, or adobe,
it gives you an
exposure of about
7 mrem a year.
With your parent or guardian, decide whether to use the long-term
or short-term test method. Short-term tests remain in your home for two
to 90 days, depending on the device. Long-term tests take longer—more
than 90 days—but are more likely to tell you your home’s year-round
average radon level. (Radon levels can vary from day to day and season
to season.)
Carefully follow the instructions that come with the kit. Keep the
test in place for as long as the instructions say, but for at least 48 hours.
Then, mail the kit to the laboratory specified. You should receive the
results in a few weeks.
If your testing shows high levels of radioactivity from radon, your
parent or guardian may wish to call the Radon Fix-It Helpline (toll-free
800-644-6999) for information on reducing radon. Fixing radon problems
is not necessarily expensive. Sealing cracks and other openings in the
foundation or coating the basement floor and walls with a flexible seal-
ant may stop some radon leaks. The radon might be sucked from below
the house and vented outdoors. Ventilating the inside of a home also
helps lower the radon level. The air outdoors usually has radioactivity
from radon of less than 0.5 pCi/L.

Exposures From Manufactured Radiation
In daily life, people also can get radiation (60 mrem a year,

mantles emit small amounts. If you’ve gone through luggage
inspection at an airport, you have received a tiny dose of

factory areas where radioactive materials are being used, and in

X-radiation. If you live within 50 miles of a nuclear power
plant, you get perhaps 0.01 mrem per year. The figure is triple
(0.03 mrem—still very small) if you live within 50 miles of
a coal-fired power plant, because burning coal releases small
amounts of uranium into the air.
Many people are exposed to radiation for medical purposes,
such as getting thyroid scans (14 mrem) or dental, chest, and
other kinds of X-rays (7 mrem on average). Wearing a plutonium-
powered heart pacemaker can expose a person to 100 mrem a
year. The benefit of a pacemaker to steady the heartbeat or an
X-ray to check for broken bones is much greater than the
limited risk from these small radiation exposures. Even so,
you should not get X-rays you don’t need.
Since the first use of nuclear weapons in 1945, atomic
bombs have been tested all around the world. Nuclear explo-
sions spread radioactive dust called fallout. Although there has
been no testing in the air for many years, some of this fallout
is still around, but we absorb less than 1 mrem every year
from this source.
Radiation Dose Limits and ALARA
The United States has laws to limit people’s unnecessary expo-
sure to radiation. Radiation workers may be exposed to no more
than 5,000 mrem annually. Health physicists generally agree that
an average person who does not work with radioactive materials
should not be exposed to more than about 100 mrem per year
beyond the 360 mrem (average) background radiation we all
receive. That means an ordinary person’s exposure normally
should not exceed about 500 mrem per year from all sources.
Limiting unnecessary exposure is the idea behind ALARA
(as low as reasonably achievable). It is not possible to avoid
all radiation exposure, but people can take steps to keep their
exposure as low as it reasonably can be.
Three essential steps involve time, distance, and shielding.
• Time. The shorter the time a person is exposed, the less
radiation that person will receive. Imagine you are in a labo-
ratory working with a radiation source that gives off 1 rem
per hour. If you work with it for one hour, you get 1 rem;
for two hours, 2 rem; three hours, 3 rem; and so on. How
do you keep the dose down? By keeping the time down.
It’s impossible
to say exactly
what level of
radiation is safe or
dangerous for
a person. While 5
rem (5,000 mrem)
each year is used
as a maximum
limit for radiation
workers, any
unnecessary
exposure should
be avoided.


NUCLEAR SCIENCE 75
.Health Physics
• Distance. The farther a person is from a source of radiation,
the lower the radiation dose. Radiation levels decrease
dramatically with distance. A radiation source that is strong
close up is weaker farther away. Alpha radiation (emitted
by radon, for instance) travels only a short distance in air.
Beta radiation (from carbon-14, among other emitters) may
travel several feet in air.
• Shielding. Earlier you learned that a piece of paper can stop
alpha particles. Aluminum will block beta particles. Gamma
rays and X-rays are blocked by a lead or concrete shield.
Placing a radioactive source behind a massive object or other
effective shield provides a barrier to radiation. In X-ray rooms,
operators stand behind a barrier to avoid getting radiation
exposure with every patient.

physics, algebra, and geometry. In college, you probably will
major in physics, chemistry, or nuclear engineering.
To enter the field as a scientist or engineer, you will need
at least a four-year bachelor’s degree. Some positions require a
master’s degree or doctorate.
Nuclear technologists and technicians also need math and
science. Entry-level technologist jobs generally require at least
two years of college or extensive technical education.
Professionals
in any nuclear
science or
technology career
need good
communication
skills. It is
important to be
able to explain
your ideas and
your research
to other people,
whether they
are in your field
or work in other
fields, or are
members of the
general public.
To learn more, talk with your counselor and with the
people you have met while completing the require-
ments for the Nuclear Science merit badge. People
who work in this field will be your best sources for
information. Ask them how they got interested in
the field, how they trained for it, what education and
experience are required, what they like (and dislike)
about their work, and whether they would recommend
it as a career (and why or why not).


78 NUCLEAR SCIENCE
Nuclear Science Careers.
Careers in Scientific Research
Nuclear scientists study the structure, properties, and interac-
tions of atomic nuclei and how the elements were formed in
the cosmos. Experimental nuclear scientists create and analyze
experiments, while nuclear theorists interpret results from
experiments and predict new phenomena. The ultimate goal is
to understand the building blocks of nature and the physical
laws they obey.
To become a nuclear scientist, most people earn a doctor-
ate in physics or chemistry. The path to this degree takes many
years of study and research. As college students majoring in
physics or chemistry, they may take one or two specialized
nuclear science courses and participate with a nuclear science
research group.
Then, after graduation from college, they enter a doctoral
program, taking courses for the first year or two, then begin-
ning full-time research. Almost all nuclear science graduate
students are paid to go to school through fellowships, teach-
ing assistantships, research assistantships, or a combination of
these. After obtaining a doctoral degree, many work as a post-
doctoral fellow.
Nuclear scientists may choose from several careers.
• Some join a university or college, where they teach courses,
guide students, and do research.
• Some conduct full-time research at a national laboratory.
• Some assist with the operations of an accelerator to help
those doing experiments.
Some nuclear scientists have been leaders in developing
new techniques in the treatment and diagnosis of disease;
others help develop new solutions to problems in energy,
or homeland or national security.
Careers in Nuclear Medicine
Every day, tens of thousands of patients in hospitals and clin-
ics have some kind of nuclear medicine procedure. Physicians
rely on X-rays and other imaging methods to diagnose medi-
cal problems without the need for invasive surgery. Radiation
is used to treat leukemia and other types of cancer. Medical
equipment is sterilized with radiation. Radioisotopes are used
in developing more than 80 percent of all new drugs.

.Nuclear Science Careers
• Nuclear medicine technologists (NMTs) run tests on patients.
They may prepare radioactive tracers; position patients for
imaging; operate the nuclear instruments; collect, prepare,
and analyze blood samples and other biological specimens;
and prepare the information for the physician’s use in mak-
ing a diagnosis. NMTs must have a solid background in
anatomy, physiology, math, chemistry, physics, laboratory
technique, and radiation safety.
• X-ray technicians (also called radiologic technologists) pre-
pare patients for X-rays and do X-ray imaging. Most work
in hospitals, clinics, medical offices, and dental offices.
• Health physicists assure the safe use of radiation. Their job
is to protect people and the environment from its harmful
effects while applying the beneficial uses of radiation.
Careers in Nuclear Energy
Nuclear energy can help to meet the growing demand for
electricity worldwide while not emitting the large amounts
of greenhouse gases produced by power plants that burn
fossil fuels. Nuclear energy also powers ships, submarines,
and satellites, and provides electricity for some spacecraft
and space laboratories.
• Engineers design power plants and supervise their operations.
They also work in nuclear fuel manufacturing.
• Reactor operators run the controls at commercial power
plants that produce electricity.
• Nuclear energy technologists work in uranium mining
and processing.
• Radiation protection technicians at nuclear power plants
implement radiation control procedures to protect workers,
the public, the environment, and the power plants.
• Engineers, technicians, and sailors design, build, maintain,
and operate reactor plants for navy ships and submarines.
• Scientists and engineers work at the International Atomic
Energy Agency working in safeguards to promote the safe,
secure and peaceful use of nuclear technologies.

Careers in Agriculture and Food Technology
A growing world population needs more food. Radiation helps
people develop plants that yield bigger crops, control pests
without toxic chemicals, and make foods safer.
• Operators at irradiation facilities use radiation to destroy
harmful microorganisms like salmonella and E. coli.
• Biologists experiment to develop new varieties of hardier,
more disease-resistant crops.
• Research assistants help scientists and food engineers collect
and analyze data.
