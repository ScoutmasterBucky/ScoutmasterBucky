Note to the Counselor
We enjoy our environment, especially during Scouting activities.
There is so much to learn about the science behind our
environment.
Scouts are strongly encouraged to discuss the badge with
their counselor before starting the requirements.
Scouts have a choice between Environmental Science and
Sustainability merit badges on their Trail to Eagle. These brief
descriptors may help you explain to the Scout so they can
decide which to pick:
• Environmental Science: is about our place in the ecosystem
and that our actions have impacts on all other living things.
It’s about the science of our place in and interrelationships
within the ecosystem. (Science)
• Sustainability: is about social responsibility, knowing that
we share the planet with 8 billion other people. Our respon-
sible actions can ensure that we continue to use resources
in ways that allow others to have that ability in the future.
(Ethics)
Our environment is a whole connected network of life
around us. Our neighborhoods, our camps, our communities,
and our world. We are responsible for protecting the
environment and leaving it better for future generations.
Environmental science seeks to understand and protect our
environment. In this merit badge, Scouts will learn to
appreciate various aspects of Environmental Science.
In the requirements, “living organisms” include both
animals and plants, where “animals” include insects, birds,
vertebrates, and worms; “plants” include trees, ferns, mosses,
grasses, flowers, and crops, as well as mushrooms and other
fungi. Microscopic organisms are environmentally important,
but Scouts are not asked to consider them for this badge.
Scouts are encouraged, but not required, to involve their
family in some of the requirements.
If this merit badge is done at camp, it’s helpful to get
water- and air-quality reports for the camp ahead of time for
the Scouts’ use.
