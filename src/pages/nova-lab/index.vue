    <h1>Welcome to Scoutmaster Bucky's Nova Lab!</h1>

    <p>
        STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) has been a part of
        Scouts since the earliest times. Youth were encouraged to observe the
        world around them, analyze problems, experiment, and come up with
        solutions and new information. This applies to topics ranging from
        programming (technology) to model design and building (engineering). It
        even helps us understand the typical "Scouting skills" such as campfires
        (the science of chemistry) and knots (mathematics and knot theory).
    </p>

    <p>These four subject areas tie into our life every day.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The food that you are eating has been tested for nutrient value and
            often balanced to ensure a healthy diet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Automobiles are fine tuned for maximizing performance while
            minimizing fuel costs and environmental damage.
        </li>
        <li>
            Video games have physics engines to make them more realistic with
            regard to objects, lighting, and the environment.
        </li>
        <li>
            Better farming techniques are researched in order to produce more
            yield, including in the cotton industry for your clothes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Even the paper you use has been researched and new formulas have
            been found in order to have it last longer or work better.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nova and Supernova Awards</h2>

    <p>
        Because of how prevalent and important these fields of research are, Boy
        Scouts of America has created Nova and Supernova awards. The Cub Scout,
        Scouts BSA, Venturer, or Sea Scout can complete some of the requirements
        for rank advancement or typical progression. A little extra work will be
        rewarded with the Nova Award patch. Subsequent Nova Awards are rewarded
        with a device that's pinned to the patch.
    </p>

    <p>
        Earning a Nova award, at a very high level, looks like this for the
        different programs:
    </p>

    <p>
        <b><a href="/nova-lab/cub-scouts/">Cub Scouts</a>:</b> 1 hour of study,
        1 STEM-related adventure or equivalent, an exploration into a field, and
        discussions with a Nova counselor. Often drawings, charts, posters, or
        other visual aids are created. The Scout takes on a couple of
        experiments and reports on the findings.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b><a href="/nova-lab/scouts-bsa/">Scouts BSA</a>:</b> 3 hours of study,
        1 STEM-related merit badge, additional research into a field, some
        actual work, and discussions with a Nova counselor. Visual aids are
        often produced in the form of models, charts, drawings, presentations,
        or reports. The additional work that is performed is sufficient to have
        a good sample of that field in order to gain further understanding.
    </p>

        <a href="explorations/">STEM-related exploration</a>, additional
        research into a field, some actual work, and discussions with a Nova

    <p>
        After earning some Nova awards, the next step is to work on a
        <a href="supernova/">Supernova Award</a>. The Supernova starts with
        <a href="explorations/">STEM explorations</a> and then learning more
        about <a href="supernova/activity-topics/">activity topics</a>. When
        achieving a Supernova Award, the recipient is given a medal instead of a
        patch or a pin. The lowest award is bronze, and that's roughly the same
        amount of work as a Nova Award. After that, you can achieve silver and
        gold, depending on your program -

    </p>

    <p>
        These medals are rarely seen, which makes them extremely interesting.
        They may be worn during formal events, such as at Blue and Gold
        ceremonies, Courts of Honor, and bridging from a pack to a troop.
