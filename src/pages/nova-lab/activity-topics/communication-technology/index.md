# Communication Technology

This activity can be done individually or in a group. It requires the participation of 20 to 30 people.

**The scenario:** You are the communication chair for a science fair being organized by your unit. Your responsibility is to gather contact information from all participants (contestants, judges, staff, and so on) and formulate a communication plan that will be effective for anticipated communications and necessary-but-unexpected communications as well. You will need to be able to communicate some information to everyone, other information to subgroups, and additional information to another group of individuals.

### Part 1: Communication Plan
