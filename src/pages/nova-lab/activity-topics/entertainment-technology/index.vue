    <h2>Entertainment Technology</h2>

    <p>
        This activity can be done individually or in a group. Many of today's
        movies involve extensive use of technology to create illusions of
        magnificent landscapes, mythical beasts, epic battle scenes, and so on.
        This activity involves learning about some of these technologies and
        applying them in a real-life setting.

    <h3>Part 1: Building Knowledge</h3>

    <p>
        Choose a favorite, recent movie that is heavily laden with special
        effects, available for home viewing, and accompanied by supplemental
        material that describes and shows how the special effects were created.
        After you have chosen a movie, do the following:

    <h3>Part 2: Creating a Grand Illusion</h3>

    <p>
        Develop a plan for creating a still photo or a short video that would
        require special effects to convey the image or action that you desire to
        show. Be sure you share your plan with your mentor before you get
        started. For a still photo, make a crude sketch of what you want the
        photo to look like. For a video, make a storyboard of the action
        sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
        A storyboard is a sequence of rough illustrations that depict the
        primary scenes or action shots of your story.
    </p>

    <p>
        In either case, describe the special effects you would use to create
        each element of the piece. Discuss the following with your mentor:
    </p>

    <Requirements :requirements="requirementsPart2" />

    <p>
        The elements of the video/photo that you created must be planned and
        implemented using the highest safety protocols. Have your mentor
        examineyour plan and suggest improvements. Your mentor must approve it
        before you get started. Create a report that shows your understanding of
        special effects and how they might be applied to the photo or video that
        you envisioned.
