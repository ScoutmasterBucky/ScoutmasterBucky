    <p>
        Each STEM field - science, technology, engineering, mathematics - offers
        a choice of three Supernova activity topics. These are two-part,
        hands-on, high-level activities created to challenge you and help you
        continue along your STEM journey to excellence. Part 1 involves
        research, preparation, set up, coordination, and/or organization. Part 2
        includes elements such as analysis, reflection, experimentation, design,
        or invention, and culminates in a report created by you.
    </p>

    <h3>Report Format Options</h3>

    <p>
        No matter what STEM activity you choose, you will need to create a
        report. Reports are a regular part of the work of professionals in STEM
        fields, so this will be good preparation for future career demands.
        Notice it doesn’t say write a report. You are not restricted to just
        writing a report, although you may choose to do so if you like. Any
        report will probably involve some writing, but the report itself may be
        created and presented in any number of ways. Use your imagination!
    </p>

    <p>
        You may choose from any format below for your report, or you may create
        a combination of formats. You may create something entirely new as long
        as your Supernova mentor approves. The objective is for you to
        communicate to others in a way that helps them understand what you have
        learned and how you learned it.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Oral report</li>
        <li>Written report</li>
        <li>Poster presentation</li>
        <li>Virtual poster</li>
        <li>Video production</li>
        <li>Multifaceted format</li>
        <li>
            Any format of your own design, with your mentor’s advance approval
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The report must provide sufficient detail so that someone unfamiliar
        with the topic can understand the content. For each format, you can
        incorporate a variety of ways to present your information and to use
        technology to create a polished presentation. For example, an oral
        report might include a PowerPoint presentation, or a poster presentation
        might include a slide show. Be creative.
    </p>

    <h3>A Note About Resources</h3>

    <p>
        The books and websites provided for each superactivity topic are
        presented as optional resources and are merely suggestions. In most
        cases, they are not crucial to the corresponding activities. Scouting
        America makes no guarantee that they will be available in local public
        libraries, from booksellers, or online.
    </p>

    <p>
        The resources represent examples of the types you might use to support
        your work on a particular activity. You may very well find alternative
        and/or additional resources that serve you as well or better than those
        presented here.

    <h2><em>Have Fun!</em></h2>

    <p>
        It is important that everyone has fun with these topics. It is difficult
        for STEM activities to be boring when the audience is fully engaged.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you're having fun with these, you should look into Scoutmaster
        Bucky's <a href="/nova-lab/">Nova Lab</a> for more fun ideas and awards.
