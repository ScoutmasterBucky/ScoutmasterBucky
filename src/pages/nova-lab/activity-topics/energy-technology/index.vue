    <h2>Energy Technology</h2>

    <p>
        This activity can be done individually or in a group. The technology to
        harness energy has always been a significant factor in human progress.
        The harnessing of energy from wind, sun, water, biomass, fossil fuels,
        and other sources has evolved dramatically over time.

    <h3>Part 1: Field Trip</h3>

    <p>
        Arrange and go on a field trip to a site where you can learn about
        innovative and/or historical examples of energy production, storage, and
        use and the ways people are making such processes sustainable. Possible
        sites include power plants, fuel manufacturers or refineries, power
        generation sites, energy- or resource-efficient buildings, historical
        sites of energy use or production, educational centers, museums, and so
        on.
