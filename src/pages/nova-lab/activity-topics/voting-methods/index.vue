    <h3>A Paradox of Counting: Voting Methods and Fair Decisions</h3>

    <p>
        This activity can be done individually or with a group of two to six
        people, and requires cooperation from about 20 to 30 individuals.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>The scenario:</b> Your unit wants to plan a superactivity for next
        summer but cannot agree on what that activity should be. There are four
        options under consideration, and your unit decides to vote. Your task is
        to collect ballots and tabulate results using several different voting
        methods.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is not a binding decision on your unit! This is an exercise, but
        one that will be more meaningful if you use real-life possibilities.
    </p>
