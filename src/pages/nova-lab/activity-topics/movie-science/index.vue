    <h2>Movie “Science”: Misconceptions, Misunderstandings, and Mistakes</h2>

    <p>
        This activity can be done individually or in a group. There are many
        popular movies and television shows with plots that involve space travel
        in the near or distant future. Your task in this activity is to watch
        one such production and identify scientific or technological advances
        that appear to be possible and those that appear to be impossible and
        explain.
    </p>

    <p>
        Create a report that is addressed to the producers of your chosen movie
        or show, from the perspective of a scientist hired as a consultant on
        the production. Include suggestions for the producers to make the movie
        more scientifically or technologically accurate, realistic, and
        plausible.
