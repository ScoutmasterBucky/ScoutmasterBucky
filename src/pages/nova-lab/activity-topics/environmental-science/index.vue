    <h2>Environmental Science: New Things From Old</h2>

    <p>
        This activity can be done individually or in a group. Your task is to
        investigate the logistics and environmental value of recycling and
        repurposing used items into new products and to invent a product that is
        predominantly made from used item(s).
