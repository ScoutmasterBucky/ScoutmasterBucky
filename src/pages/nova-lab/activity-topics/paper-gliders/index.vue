    <h2>Build and Test: High Performance Paper Gliders</h2>

    <p>
        This activity can be done individually, but works much better with at
        least two people. Your task is to measure how differences in design
        affect the flight characteristics of a glider. You will accomplish this
        by building and testing some high-performance paper gliders. These
        gliders use a laminated construction method that helps simulate a real
        glider much more closely than a simple folded piece of paper.

    <h3>Part 2: Analyze and Report</h3>

    <p>
        Present to your mentor your recorded data in a tabular format as well as
        a graphical format. (You may use Excel if you wish.) Then do the
        following:
