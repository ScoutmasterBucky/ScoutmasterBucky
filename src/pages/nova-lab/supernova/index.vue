        Supernova awards are ways to reward Scouts for learning more about STEM
        (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) subjects. The Supernova
        awards are earned as the next step after achieving
        <a href="../">Nova awards</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        When a Scout of any program earns a bronze or silver Supernova award,
        they should be presented the medal at their Court of Honor (or similar
        ceremony). This medal can be worn on the uniform during formal
        ceremonies. There are also pins for each level of award (bronze, silver,
        gold), award certificates, and a Supernova mentor pin that could be
        awarded back to adults as appreciation.

    <p>
        Earning the gold Dr. Albert Einstein Supernova award is a rare and
        impressive achievement and should be recognized with a special ceremony.
        Official advice is to present this achievement at a significant event,
        such as a major STEM event, annual council Awards event, or other
        high-profile Scouting function.
