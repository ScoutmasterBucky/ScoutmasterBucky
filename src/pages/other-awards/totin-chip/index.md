The Totin' Chip is awarded to Scouts that learn and demonstrate the proper
ability to safely handle and use bladed tools.

The privileges this award grants are able to be taken away if the Scout fails
in their responsibility.

When earned, the Scout may receive the Totin Chip patch, the Totin Chip card,
or both.
