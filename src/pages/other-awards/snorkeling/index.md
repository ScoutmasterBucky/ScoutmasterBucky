The Snorkeling BSA requirements introduce the special skills, equipment, and
safety precautions associated with snorkeling; encourage the development of
aquatics skills that promote fitness and recreation; and provide a foundation
for those who later will participate in more advanced underwater activity.

Any youth or adult who is registered with a troop, crew, or ship and completes
the requirements is eligible for a patch and recognition card. The completed
award application should be handled as directed by the council Training,
Aquatics, or other committee.

All counselors must have current Safe Swim Defense training and council
approval. Anyone currently trained as a Scouting America Aquatics Instructor or
certified as a snorkeling instructor by a Scouting America recognized scuba
training agency may serve as a counselor for the Snorkeling BSA award. Councils may
also approve counselors who have been trained and are supervised by those with
the previously listed credentials.

Instruction must be conducted in clear, confined water with a maximum depth of
12 feet. A swimming pool is recommended. Snorkeling is ideally suited to winter
programs using indoor pools. Three 45-minute sessions are recommended for
instruction, practice, and completion of requirements.

All aspects of Safe Swim Defense apply during instruction, practice, and
all other snorkeling activities. Snorkeling in open water requires each
participant to first demonstrate knowledge and skills equivalent to the
Snorkeling requirements.

[Aquatics Supervision: A Leader's Guide to Youth Swimming and Boating
Activities, No.
34346](https://filestore.scoutmasterbucky.com/other-awards/aquatics-guide.pdf),
provides reference material for Snorkeling BSA instruction. Scuba training
agencies, equipment manufacturers, and others occasionally publish references
available online and through bookstores and dive shops. Although few dedicated
snorkeling texts are available, instruction manuals for scuba diving contain
pertinent information.

All requirements must be completed as stated on the application form. The
counselor may not omit, vary, or add requirements. The skill requirements are
listed in an order appropriate for instruction.

The second requirement considers the time-honored and time-proven principle of
the buddy system. Snorkelers must use the buddy system at all times. Before
beginning the activity, each person helps their buddy fit and check equipment.
The principle of the buddy system is that two people can enjoy an aquatics
activity together while each provides a critical margin of safety for the
other. Each buddy must constantly be aware of the condition and circumstances
of their buddy, and must always be prepared to call for aid or give immediate
assistance if needed.

_Swimsuit / swim trunks emblem - The Snorkeling BSA patch is NOT worn on the
uniform or the sash; it is worn on the left side of the swimsuit / swim
trunks._

Upon successful completion, participants earn the Snorkeling BSA patch along
with their achievement card. Completion indicates the individual has
experienced a valuable introduction to snorkeling.
