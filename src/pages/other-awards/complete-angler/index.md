The Scouting America Complete Angler Award honors Scouts who earn all three fishing-related merit badges: [Fishing](/merit-badges/fishing/), [Fly-Fishing](/merit-badges/fly-fishing/), and [Fish & Wildlife Management](/merit-badges/fish-and-wildlife-management/).

The Fishing merit badge was one of the original merit badges and over two million have earned it. In a recent Scout's Life (formerly Boys’ Life) survey, fishing placed 4th overall as the preferred outdoor activity, surpassed only by camping, swimming and bicycling. What better way to keep older Scouts involved than by expanding on this trend?

After completing the Complete Angler recognition, these older Scouts can become mentors for younger Scouts, sharing their knowledge and helping others to enjoy a positive fishing experience.

_The Complete Angler patch is available as a patch which may be worn as a temproary patch on the right pocket of any Scouting uniform._
