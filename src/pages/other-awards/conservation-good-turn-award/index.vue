    <h3>Conservation Good Turn Award</h3>

    <p>Since 1910, conservation has been an integral part of the program of Scouting America. Scouting America has been a positive force in conservation and environmental efforts. Scouts have rendered distinguished public service by helping to conserve wildlife, energy, forests, soil, and water. Past generations of Scouts have been widely recognized for undertaking conservation Good Turn action projects in their local communities.</p>

    <p>Scouts of today have grown up hearing words such as ecosystem, biodiversity, and climate change. They recognize the need for, and the benefits of, conserving natural resources. Scouts understand that we all must work together for the betterment of the land, forests, wildlife, air, and water.</p>

    <p>Much has been accomplished in recent years by individual Scouts and through unit conservation Good Turns. Much more needs to be done.</p>

    <p>Conservation and environmental organizations typically have a backlog of needed projects that they have been unable to carry out for lack of funding or volunteers. The list of possible Good Turn projects is limited only by the needs of the conservation organization and the willingness of the Scouting unit. In every community, whether urban, suburban, or rural, worthwhile projects await all Scouting units.</p>

    <p>When project has been completed, submit the completed <a href="https://www.scouting.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Conservation-Good-Trun-Award-Application-Fillable.pdf">Conservation Good Turn Award Application</a> to your local council service center.</p>

    <p>Patches may purchased at the Scout Shop to provide to individuals who participated in the project work. This patch may be worn as a temporary patch on the right pocket of the Scout uniform or on the back of the sash.</p>
