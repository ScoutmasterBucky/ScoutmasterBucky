Since 1910, conservation has been an integral part of the program of Scouting
America. Scouting America has been a positive force in conservation and
environmental efforts. Scouts have rendered distinguished public service by
helping to conserve wildlife, energy, forests, soil, and water. Past
generations of Scouts have been widely recognized for undertaking conservation
Good Turn action projects in their local communities.

Scouts of today have grown up hearing words such as ecosystem, biodiversity,
and climate change. They recognize the need for, and the benefits of,
conserving natural resources. Scouts understand that we all must work together
for the betterment of the land, forests, wildlife, air, and water.

Much has been accomplished in recent years by individual Scouts and through
unit conservation Good Turns. Much more needs to be done.

Conservation and environmental organizations typically have a backlog of needed
projects that they have been unable to carry out for lack of funding or
volunteers. The list of possible Good Turn projects is limited only by the
needs of the conservation organization and the willingness of the Scouting
unit. In every community, whether urban, suburban, or rural, worthwhile
projects await all Scouting units.

When project has been completed, submit the completed [Conservation Good Turn

to your local council service center.

Patches may purchased at the Scout Shop to provide to individuals who
participated in the project work. This patch may be worn as a temporary patch
on the right pocket of the Scout uniform or on the back of the sash.
