Boardsailing BSA has been developed to introduce basic boardsailing
skills, equipment, and safety precautions; to encourage the development
of skills that promote fitness and safe aquatic recreation; and to lay a
foundation for more advanced and demanding boardsailing activities. Any
youth or adult who is registered with a troop, crew, or ship and
completes the requirements is eligible for a patch and recognition card.
The completed award application should be handled as directed by the
council Training, Aquatics, or other committee.

All counselors must be trained in Safety Afloat and have council
approval. Any person recognized as a boardsailing instructor by US
Windsurfing or US Sailing, or someone with similar experience in
boardsailing skills, safety, and instruction, may serve as a counselor
for this award.

Instruction must be conducted on a protected body of water in an area
free from other traffic or large waves. Initial water entry and practice
should be on a gradual beach clear of hazards. A steady three-to-seven
knot breeze is ideal for beginner practice. All participants should be
close enough to supervisory personnel for efficient instruction and
ready assistance.

All requirements must be completed as stated. Basic skills and safety
precautions are presented in the Scouting America publication: [Aquatics
Supervision: A Youth Leader's Guide for Swimming and Boating Activities, No.
34346](/other-awards/aquatics-guide.pdf). Additional resources may be found
online at [www.uswindsurfing.org](https://www.uswindsurfing.org) and
[www.ussailing.org](https://www.ussailing.org).

_Swimsuit / swim trunks emblem - The Boardsailing BSA patch is NOT worn on the
uniform or the sash; it is worn on the left side of the swimsuit / swim

Upon successful completion, participants earn the Boardsailing BSA patch along
with their achievement card. Completion indicates the individual has
experienced a valuable introduction to boardsailing.
