The World Conservation Award provides an opportunity for individual Wolf
Scouts, Bear Scouts, Webelos Scouts, Scouts BSA, Sea Scouts, and Venturers to
“think globally” and “act locally” to conserve and improve our environment.
This program is designed to make youth members aware that all nations are
closely related through natural resources, and that we and our world
environment are interdependent.

_The emblem is worn centered on the right pocket of the Scout uniform shirt as
a temporary patch or may be placed on the back of the merit badge sash._

Upon successful completion, participants earn the Whitewater Rafting patch
along with their achievement card. Completion indicates the individual has
experienced a valuable introduction to whitewater rafting.
