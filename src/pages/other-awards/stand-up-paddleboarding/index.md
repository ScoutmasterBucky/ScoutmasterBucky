Any youth or adult who is registered with a troop, crew, or ship and completes
the requirements is eligible for a patch and recognition card. The completed
award application should be handled as directed by the council Training,
Aquatics, or other committee. Instruction for the Scouting America SUP award is
to be conducted under safe conditions on calm water. One to three hours in one
or more sessions should suffice for instruction and practice.

Information and skills are discussed in [Aquatics Supervision: A Leader's Guide
to Youth Swimming and Boating Activities, No.
34346](/other-awards/aquatics-guide.pdf), and the SUP brochure at
www.scouting.org. All counselors must be trained in Safety Afloat and have
council approval. Any person with current training as a BSA Aquatics Instructor
or as a SUP instructor by the American Canoe Association, or a person with
similar experience in SUP skills, safety, and instruction may serve as a
counselor.

_Swimsuit / swim trunks emblem - The BSA Stand Up Paddleboarding patch is NOT
worn on the uniform or the sash; it is worn on the left side of the swimsuit /

Upon successful completion, participants earn the BSA Stand Up Paddleboarding
patch along with their achievement card. Completion indicates the individual
has experienced a valuable introduction to stand up paddleboarding.
