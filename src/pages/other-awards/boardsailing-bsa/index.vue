    <h3>Boardsailing BSA</h3>

    <p>
        Boardsailing BSA has been developed to introduce basic boardsailing
        skills, equipment, and safety precautions; to encourage the development
        of skills that promote fitness and safe aquatic recreation; and to lay a
        foundation for more advanced and demanding boardsailing activities. Any
        youth or adult who is registered with a troop, crew, or ship and
        completes the requirements is eligible for a patch and recognition card.
        The completed award application should be handled as directed by the
        council Training, Aquatics, or other committee.
    </p>

    <p>
        All counselors must be trained in Safety Afloat and have council
        approval. Any person recognized as a boardsailing instructor by US
        Windsurfing or US Sailing, or someone with similar experience in
        boardsailing skills, safety, and instruction, may serve as a counselor
        for this award.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instruction must be conducted on a protected body of water in an area
        free from other traffic or large waves. Initial water entry and practice
        should be on a gradual beach clear of hazards. A steady three-to-seven
        knot breeze is ideal for beginner practice. All participants should be
        close enough to supervisory personnel for efficient instruction and
        ready assistance.
    </p>

    <p>
        All requirements must be completed as stated. Basic skills and safety
        precautions are presented in the BSA publication:
        <a href="/other-awards/aquatics-guide.pdf"
            >Aquatics Supervision: A Youth Leaderâ€™s Guide for Swimming and
            Boating Activities, No. 34346</a
        >. Additional resources may be found online at

        >
    </p>

    <p>
        Upon successful completion, participants earn the Boardsailing BSA patch
        along with their achievement card. Completion indicates the individual
        has experienced a valuable introduction to boardsailing.
