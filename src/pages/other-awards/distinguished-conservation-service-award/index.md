Conservation and Scouting America have been partners for a long time. Camping,
hiking, and respect for the outdoors are a part of the Scouting heritage. Many
of the requirements for advancement from Tenderfoot through the Eagle Scout
rank call for an increasing awareness and understanding of the natural
sciences. Many former Scouts have become leaders in conserving our environment
and protecting it from abuse. Right now, Scouts are involved in learning about
environmental problems and actively working to make a difference.

The fundamental purpose of the Scouting America Distinguished Conservation
Service Awards program is to encourage learning by the participants and to
increase public awareness about natural resource conservation. Understanding
and practicing sound stewardship of natural resources and environmental
protection strengthens Scouting’s emphasis on respecting the outdoors. The goal
of this awards program is to encourage and recognize truly outstanding efforts
undertaken by Scouting units, Scouts and Venturers, adult Scouters, and other
individuals, corporations, and institutions that have contributed significantly
to natural resource conservation and environmental protection.

The Scouting America Distinguished Conservation Service Award Individual awards
are granted by the National Council through the local Council’s Conservation
Committee to a member of a Scouts BSA, Sea Scout, or Venturing unit for
exceptional and distinguished service to conservation and environmental
improvement.

The award, the most distinguished in Scouting for exceptional conservation
service, will be awarded for clearly outstanding efforts in planning,
leadership, execution of plans, involvement of others, and opportunities taken
to help others learn about natural resource conservation and environmental
improvement.
