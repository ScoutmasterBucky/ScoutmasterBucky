    <h3>BSA Stand Up Paddleboarding</h3>

    <p>
        Any youth or adult who is registered with a troop, crew, or ship and
        completes the requirements is eligible for a patch and recognition card.
        The completed award application should be handled as directed by the
        council Training, Aquatics, or other committee. Instruction for the BSA
        SUP award is to be conducted under safe conditions on calm water. One to
        three hours in one or more sessions should suffice for instruction and
        practice.
    </p>

    <p>
        Information and skills are discussed in
        <a href="../aquatics-guide.pdf"
            >Aquatics Supervision: A Leaderâ€™s Guide to Youth Swimming and
            Boating Activities, No. 34346</a
        >, and the BSA SUP brochure at www.scouting.org. All counselors must be
        trained in Safety Afloat and have council approval. Any person with
        current training as a BSA Aquatics Instructor or as a SUP instructor by
        the American Canoe Association, or a person with similar experience in
        SUP skills, safety, and instruction may serve as a counselor.
