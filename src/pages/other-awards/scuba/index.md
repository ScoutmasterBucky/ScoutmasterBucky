All aspects of the Scuba BSA program must conform with the Scouting America
scuba policy found in the Guide to Safe Scouting. Instructors not familiar with
the Scouting program should consult the Scouting America manual, [Aquatics
Supervision: A Leader's Guide to Youth Swimming and Boating Activities, No.
34346](https://filestore.scoutmasterbucky.com/other-awards/aquatics-guide.pdf),
which also contains the Scouting America scuba policy.

Counselors for Scuba BSA must hold current scuba instructor certification from
PADI, NAUI, SSI, or RSTC member organizations.  Instruction must comply with
RSTC standards for introductory scuba experiences. Minimum standards include
instructor-to-participant ratios.  In a pool, the maximum ratio is eight
participants per instructor. In a confined waterfront setting, the maximum
ratio is four participants per instructor. Ratios may be increased by two
participants if the instructor is assisted by someone certified as a divemaster
or assistant instructor.

A second adult who understands the procedures should be present in case the
instructor becomes incapacitated. Two-deep adult leadership is also required by
BSA Youth Protection guidelines.

Before participants are allowed in the water, they must complete an Annual
Health and Medical Record designed for scuba activities.  Instructors should
use standard forms advocated by their certifying agency.

Instructors may use agency materials, such as participant guidebooks, slide
shows, and videos to help convey cognitive material. Skill instruction must be
conducted in clear, confined water. A swimming pool is recommended.

Scuba BSA is ideally suited to winter programs using indoor pools. Two
45-minute sessions are appropriate for instruction, practice, and completion of
requirements.

Although Scuba BSA is similar to introductory scuba experiences offered by
various RSTC member organizations and other dive agencies, those programs are
not substitutes for Scuba BSA. All requirements must be completed as stated on
the application form. The counselor may not omit, vary, or add requirements. In
particular, Scuba BSA has a prerequisite swimming requirement, is only
available to youth and adults registered in the Scouts BSA, Venturing, or Sea
Scout programs (minimum age around 10½), and does not include the option of an
open-water dive.

Local council programs may not compress or sell air for scuba use, or sell,
rent, or loan scuba equipment. All air and equipment for local council Scuba
BSA programs must be obtained from properly licensed sources, not affiliated
with the Boy Scouts of America and under the supervision of PADI, NAUI, SSI, or
RSTC-approved and certified scuba instructors.

Individuals completing the Scuba BSA requirements qualify for a recognition
card and patch. The completed award application should be handled as directed
by the council Training, Aquatics, or other committee.

_The counselor must hold an instructor rating with current teaching status with
PADI, NAUI, SSI, or RSTC member organization in accordance with Scouting
America scuba policies in the Guide to Safe Scouting.  Counselors must have
council approval._

_Swimsuit / swim trunks emblem - The Scuba BSA patch is NOT worn on the uniform
or the sash; it is worn on the left side of the swimsuit / swim trunks._

Upon successful completion, participants earn the Scuba BSA patch along with
their achievement card. Completion indicates the individual has experienced a
valuable introduction to scuba.
