    <h3>Keep America Beautiful - Hometown U.S.A. Award</h3>

    <p>A youth program between Keep America Beautiful Inc. and Scouting America that recognizes outstanding efforts of Scouts in their communities in regard to citizenship and environmental improvement; provides way for Scouts to make significant contribution toward keeping America beautiful.</p>

    <p>Keep America Beautiful was founded in 1953 with the purpose of building and sustaining a national cleanliness ethic. Scouting America has been affiliated with Keep America Beautiful for more than 50 years at the national level and through KABâ€™s national network of more than 600 community affiliates.</p>

    <p>In 1971, Scouting Keep America Beautiful Day was first cosponsored by KAB and Scouting America as a massive national cleanup and recycling program. Millions of Scouts still turn out annually to participate in community-enriching activities such as the Great American Cleanup and America Recycles Day.</p>
