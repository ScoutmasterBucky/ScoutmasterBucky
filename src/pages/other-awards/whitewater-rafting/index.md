This award is available to Scouting America members, Venturers, Sea Scouts, and
Explorers, and adult leaders in these programs. Any adult leader, approved by
the council, who is trained in Safety Afloat and can personally verify that all
instruction and skill completions were directly supervised by a professionally
trained or licensed rafting guide may serve as a counselor for this award. Such
guides may be employed by council high-adventure programs or commercial
outfitters. Guidance for selecting a reputable rafting service is provided in
the *Aquatics Supervision* publication, No. 34346.
