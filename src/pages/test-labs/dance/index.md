Dancing is a fun and exciting way to express yourself, stay active, and connect
with others. Every style of dance—from hip hop and ballet to cultural and
partner dances—has its own rhythm, history, and story to tell. In the Dance
Test Lab Badge, you’ll learn how to move safely, warm up properly, and
understand what makes every dance unique. You’ll explore different styles of
dance, learn about famous dancers, and even perform your own routine. Whether
you’re new to dancing or already love it, this badge will help you build
confidence, creativity, and coordination while having a great time moving to
the beat.
