The Auctioneering Badge is a dynamic blend of public speaking and salesmanship
that offers Scouts the opportunity to develop essential communication and
persuasion skills. Scouts will learn about the history of auctioneering,
develop presentation techniques, and build rapport with an audience. They’ll
engage in mock auctions to practice creating demand and closing deals while
also learning how to handle challenges and uphold ethical standards. This badge
fosters confidence and critical thinking skills that are powerful tools for
personal growth, leadership roles, and future success.
