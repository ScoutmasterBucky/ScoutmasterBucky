    <h1>Merit Badge History Pages</h1>

    <p>
        When one is asked about the icons of Scouting, the most commonly
        identified are: the campfire, the uniform, and merit badges. The merit
        badge program has delivered knowledge, skills and career awareness to
        millions of youth for the last 100 years.

        The preface of Scouting for Boys, written in 1908, by Lord Robert
        Baden-Powell; the founder of the worldwide Scouting movement, included a
        description of the four components of the Scouting program. The second
        of those components was, "Handicrafts or hobbies which may help a boy to
        make his way in life, for which we give ‘Proficiency’ badges."

    <p>
        In 1910, the American Scouting movement was incorporated by William D
        Boyce and others. The original edition of The Official Handbook for Boys
        was published in 1911 to standardize the program. In addressing merit
        badges, known at that time as Badges of Merit, the manual stated, "These
        badges are intended to stimulate the boy’s interest in the life about
        him and are given for general knowledge". That purpose has changed
        little since those early days. Recent editions of the Boy Scout Handbook
        stated, "A merit badge is an invitation to explore an exciting
        subject... some merit badges encourage you to increase your skill in
        subjects you already like, while others challenge you to learn about new
        areas of knowledge ... a merit badge can even lead you toward a lifelong
        hobby or set you on the way to a rewarding career."

        Ernest Thompson-Seton, an author, nature artist, and naturalist from New
        York, was commissioned to adapt Scouting for Boys into a manual for the
        new BSA organization and his 1910 publication included 14 Badges of
        Merit. The following year, a more comprehensive manual was released by
        the BSA and is considered the original handbook. The Official Handbook
        for Boys listed 57 different merit badges available to Scouts. From that
        point on, national leaders of the organization have considered and
        approved merit badges on subjects that interest boys and helped to
        achieve the purposes of the BSA.
