The Life Skills Badge helps Scouts develop a variety of practical skills that
are essential for independent living and personal growth. It covers areas such
as health, household management, finance, social interactions, employment
readiness, and transportation. Scouts learn how to maintain their physical and
mental well-being, manage personal finances, care for their living spaces,
communicate effectively with others, explore career options, and safely
navigate transportation systems. By completing the requirements, Scouts gain
valuable tools for responsible decision-making and become better prepared to
take on adult responsibilities.
