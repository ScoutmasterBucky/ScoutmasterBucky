Every year, millions of acres, throughout the United States are lost to
destructive wildfires. Billions of dollars are spent annually and the loss of
property and life is catastrophic. Smoke from American and Canadian wildfires
can spread across the country affecting the public health of millions of people
annually. Wildfire has become a national crisis in the United States.

As destructive as wildfire can be, managed wildland fire can also be
beneficial. Fire plays a critical process in many ecosystems and can enhance
habitats, reduce fuel loads and support forest regeneration.

Understanding and managing wildland fire is a complex undertaking. Striking a
balance between preventing and supressing harmful human-caused wildfire while
promoting beneficial fire in the landscape will be the challenge as we continue
to live with fire in the United States.

As Scouts, we can learn and do our part to make our homes, our camps and our
communities more resilient and resistant to wildfire and we can understand the
natural role that fire plays in our nation’s wildlands. We can explore and
consider careers in wildland fire management or even become wildland
firefighters, The future of wildland fire management in the United States will
require leaders who are conservation-minded.

Welcome to Wildland Fire Management Badge, where you will learn about these
concepts and more!
