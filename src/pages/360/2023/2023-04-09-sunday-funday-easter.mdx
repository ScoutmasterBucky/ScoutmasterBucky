Happy Easter to all my Peeps

After all the festivities and eating that make Easter such an important day, something light (literally and figuratively) to discuss.... Peeps

Beautiful SPring weather allowed me to chill outside with my Peeps and create today's video.  Did you know that the Peeps factory in Pennsylvania can produce 5.5 million Peeps per day... that's over a billion a year.  That's a LOT of sugar!

Enjoy the video and thanks for following the **<span style="color: red">&lt;3</span>60 Awareness Project**

Happy Easter
