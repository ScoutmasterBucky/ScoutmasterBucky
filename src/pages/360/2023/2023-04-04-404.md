**April the 4th, 1984.**

***"To the past, or to the future. To an age when thought is free. From the Age of Big Brother, from the Age of the Thought Police, from a dead man - greetings!"*** *― George Orwell, 1984*

I always like trivial trivia, and one of my favorite things is "This Day in History". There's always something cool to talk about and connect with people over.  History is important as we need to learn so that we do not repeat it.

Enjoy this fun little video with some interesting 04-04, 4x4, 404, April 4th tidbits.

Hey and don't forget, it's Taco Tuesday somewhere.
