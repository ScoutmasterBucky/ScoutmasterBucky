When asking Tony to join me for the **2023 <span style="color: red">&lt;3</span>60 Awareness Project**, it didn't take much thought for him to decide on his awareness topic. Being the son of two Vietnamese immigrants, he wanted to share his view on American Citizenship and remind us of how lucky we are to live in a country that affords the right and freedoms so many others in this world yearn for.

Thank a Veteran for the freedoms you have been provided.
