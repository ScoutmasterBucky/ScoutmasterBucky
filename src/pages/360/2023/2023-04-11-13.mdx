I'd say 13 has some pretty important, or lucky, aspects to it

Rhode Island was the last of the 13 original colonies.
The American flag has 13 stripes in recognition of the colonies.
The original American flag had 13 stars, for the same reason.
Thomas Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743.
Millard Fillmore was the 13th president. He came to power after President Taylor died from stomach flu and Fillmore was the last president from the Whig Party.
The Thirteen Amendment abolished slavery

Also

The One Dollar Bill utilizes 13 units in various areas including: the bars of the shield, the leaves on the olive branch, the fruits, the arrows, the stars above the eagle, the plums of feathers on each of the eagle's wings, and the steps on the pyramid. Additionally, the letters in "E PLURIBUS UNUM ("Out of many, one"), and the letters in "ANNUIT COEPTIS" ("God has favored our undertaking") are 13 in number.

The Apollo 13 was the third manned spacecraft prepped for a moon mission. The number 13 had more connections to the spacecraft. For one thing, the rocket was launched on April 11, 1970 at 13:13 CST. On April 13, there was an onboard explosion that caused the mission to be scrapped. ("Houston, we have a problem.")
