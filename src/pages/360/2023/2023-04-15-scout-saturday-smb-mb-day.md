Just a little promo of the Merit Badge Saturdays I have been doing since January 2009. Each month during the school year (except during the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Scoutmaster Bucky Program offers an In-Person Saturday Merit Badge Day somewhere in the Twin Cities area.

Thousands of Scouts have come thru the program and hundreds of Scouting Volunteers have helped deliver the excellence.

@023 marks the beginning of our 15th year, and here's hoping for at least another 15.
