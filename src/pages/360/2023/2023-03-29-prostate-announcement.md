Today marks the day I announce on social media that I have been diagnosed with Stage 4 Prostate Cancer.  While my diagnosis came just after Thanksgiving 2022, today I start the second part of my treatment.  I have been doing Hormone Therapy for 6 weeks now and continue to work with my oncologist to refine and administer the best approach possible.

Tomorrow, March 30, 2023 I start my aggressive daily radiation routine.  Join me each day on Social Media and here on ScoutmasterBucky.com to follow my personal journey as well as my daily guests and topics that make up my newest initiative, **2023 <span style="color: red">&lt;3</span>60 Awareness Project**.

I'd love to hear your thoughts or comments so don't be shy, comment on the social media posts, or send us an email at ScoutmasterBucky@yahoo.com

Stay Positive, I certainly am

Scoutmaster Bucky
