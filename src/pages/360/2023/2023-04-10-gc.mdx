***""Be someone's security blanket when theirs is in the wash."*** *- Richelle E. Goodrich* author of  *"Making Wishes: Quotes, Thoughts, & a Little Poetry for Every Day of the Year"*

GIllette's Childrens Hospital is ALWAYS looking to help bring a little normalcy to their young patients as they navigate unfamiliar waters. While there are many ways to donate, on that is espcially near and dear to the Jurek family is the Gillette Children's Blanket Donation initiative.

A statement from Gillette Children's reads *"Patients who come to Gillette Children's are often in need of something 'friendly' or 'cuddly' while they are here. Having something to snuggle in [with] can make their hospital stay much more pleasant and comfortable."* Consider blanket donation, or even crafting one from hand like a quilt or even a fleece-tied blanket.

There are however a few requirements that must be followed when donating; and while nearly any kind of NEW or NEWLY-CRAFTED and cleaned blanket is accepted, you do still need to fill out a Gift-In-Kind Contribution Form and follow a few checklist items.  You will not be able to deliver your blankets to the patients, but be rest assured that your donation will find it's way to a young patient at Children's.

There are numerous other ways to donate, but to find out more on Blanket Donation, click <a href="https://www.gillettechildrens.org/get-involved/volunteer/home-crafter-volunteers">here</a>.
