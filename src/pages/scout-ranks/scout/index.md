All requirements for the Scout rank must be completed as a member
of a troop. If you have already completed these requirements as part of the
Webelos Scouting Adventure, simply demonstrate your knowledge or skills
to your Scoutmaster or other designated leader after joining the troop.

The requirements for Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, and First Class ranks may
be worked on simultaneously; however, these ranks must be earned in sequence.

[Alternate requirements for the Scout rank](../alternative-requirements/)
are available for Scouts with physical or mental disabilities if they meet the
criteria listed in the <b>Scouts BSA Requirements</b> book.
