**These alternative requirements are for Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, and
First Class ranks only.**

A Scout who has a permanent physical or mental disability (or a disability
expected to last more than two years or beyond the 18th birthday) and is unable
to complete all of the requirements for Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, or
First Class rank may, with their parents or guardian, submit a request to the
council advancement committee to complete alternative requirements. Below are
the procedures for applying for alternative requirements. To help facilitate
this process, use the [Individual Scout Advancement
Plan](https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/512-936_wb.pdf), No.
512-936, which can be found at
[scouting.org/advancement](https://www.scouting.org/advancement). For more
detailed information about alternative requirements, see the [Guide to
Advencement](https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/).
