A Venturer or Sea Scout must have achieved First Class rank as a Scouts BSA
member, or as a Lone Scout, in order to work on and earn Star, Life, and Eagle
Rank requirements. For Venturers working on Scouts BSA requirements, replace
"troop" with "crew" and "Scoutmaster" with "Crew Advisor." For Sea Scouts
working on Scouts BSA requirements, replace "troop" with "ship" and
"Scoutmaster" with "Skipper."
