All requirements for the Tenderfoot rank must be completed as a member of a
troop or as a Lone Scout.

The requirements for Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, and First Class ranks may
be worked on simultaneously; however, these ranks must be earned in sequence.

[Alternate requirements for the Tenderfoot rank](../alternative-requirements/)
are available for Scouts with physical or mental disabilities if they meet the
criteria listed in the <b>Scouts BSA Requirements</b> book.
