The Eagle Scout rank may be achieved by a Scouts BSA Scout or a
qualified<sup>*</sup> Venturer or Sea Scout who has a physical or mental
disability by completing the [Application for Alternative Eagle Scout Rank
Merit Badges, No.
512-730](https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/512-730.pdf), and by
qualifying for alternative merit badges. This does not apply to individual
requirements for merit badges. Merit badges are awarded only when all
requirements are met as stated. See the [Guide to
Advancement](https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/), section
10.2.2.3, for details.

The physical or mental disability must be of a permanent rather than of a
temporary nature or a disability expected to last more than two years or beyond
age 18. The application must include a written statement from a qualified
health professional related to the nature of the disability.  This person may
be a physician, neurologist, psychiatrist, psychologist, etc., or, when
appropriate, an educational administrator in special education.

Before applying, a Scout must earn as many of the Eagle-required merit badges
as possible. However, where a permanent disability clearly precludes completing
specific merit badges, a Scout who has earned at least First Class may apply
for an alternative merit badge without waiting until all other Eagle-required
merit badges are complete. Any alternatives must present the same challenge and
learning level as those they replace, and must be completed prior to the 18th
birthday unless the member is registered beyond the age of eligibility
(reference [Guide to
Advancement](https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/),
sections 10.1.0.1 - 10.1.0.2.

<sup>*</sup> In order to be an Eagle Scout candidate, a Venturer or Sea Scout
must have achieved First Class rank as a registered Scout or as a Lone Scout.
