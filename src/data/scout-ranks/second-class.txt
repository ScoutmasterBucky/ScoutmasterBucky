round, or where there are no suitably safe and accessible places (outdoors or indoors) within a reasonable traveling
distance to swim at any time during the year, the council Scout executive and advancement committee may, on an
individual Scout basis, authorize an alternative for requirements 5b and 5c. The local council may establish appropriate
procedures for submitting and processing these types of requests. All the other requirements, none of which necessitate
entry in the water or entry in a watercraft on the water, must be completed as written.
