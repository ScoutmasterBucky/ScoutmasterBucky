the Scout may request a board of review under disputed circumstances in accordance with Guide to Advancement
topic 8.0.3.2.
If the board of review does not approve the Scout’s advancement, the decision may be appealed in accordance with
Guide to Advancement topic 8.0.4.0.

rank requirements before age 18, the Scout may apply for a limited time extension in accordance with Guide to
Advancement topic 9.0.4.0. Time extensions are rarely granted and reserved only for work on Eagle.

for alternative merit badges for the rest. If you seek to become an Eagle Scout under this procedure, you must submit
a special application to your local council service center. Your application must be approved by your council
advancement committee before you can work on alternative merit badges.
