Eagle Palms
After successfully completing an Eagle Scout board of review and being
validated as an Eagle Scout by the National Service Center, a Scout can
be recognized immediately with an Eagle Palm for each additional five
merit badges they have earned, beyond the 21 merit badges required for
the rank of Eagle Scout.
Subsequently, they may earn additional Palms by completing the
following requirements:
1. Since earning the Eagle Scout rank or your last Eagle Palm,
demonstrate Scout spirit by living the Scout Oath and Scout
Law. Tell how you have done your duty to God and how you
have lived the Scout Oath and Scout Law in your everyday life.
2. Continue to set a satisfactory example of accepting responsibility
or demonstrating leadership ability.
3. Earn five additional merit badges beyond those required for
Eagle or last Palm.
You may wear only the proper combination of Palms
for the number of merit badges you earned beyond the
rank of Eagle. The Bronze Palm represents five merit
badges, the Gold Palm 10, and the Silver Palm 15.
