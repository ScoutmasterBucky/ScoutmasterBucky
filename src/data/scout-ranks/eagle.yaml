      <b>APPEALS AND EXTENSIONS</b>
      <div class="gap"></div>
      If a Scout believes all requirements for the Eagle Scout rank have been
      completed but a board of review is denied, the Scout may request a board
      of review under disputed circumstances in accordance with <a
      href="https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/">Guide to
      Advancement</a> topic 8.0.3.2.
      <div class="gap"></div>
      If the board of review does not approve the Scout's advancement, the
      decision may be appealed in accordance with <a
      href="https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/">Guide to
      Advancement</a> topic 8.0.4.0.
      <div class="gap"></div>
      If a Scout foresees that, due to no fault or choice of their own, it will
      not be possible to complete the Eagle Scout rank requirements before age
      18, the Scout may apply for a limited time extension in accordance with
      <a href="https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/">Guide
      to Advancement</a> topic 9.0.4.0. Time extensions are rarely granted and
      reserved only for work on Eagle.
      <div class="gap"></div>
      <b>AGE REQUIREMENT ELIGIBILITY</b>
      <div class="gap"></div>
      Merit badges, badges of rank, and Eagle Palms may be earned by a
      registered Scout or a qualified Venturer or Sea Scout. Scouts may earn
      these awards until their 18th birthday. Any Venturer or Sea Scout who has
      achieved the First Class rank as a Scout in a troop may continue working
      up to their 18th birthday toward the Star, Life, and Eagle Scout ranks
      and Eagle Palms.
      <div class="gap"></div>
      An Eagle Scout board of review may occur, without special approval,
      within 24 months after the 18th birthday. <b>Consult the <a
      href="https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/">Guide to
      Advancement</a> topic 8.0.3.1, if a Board of Review is to be conducted
      more than 24 months after the candidate's 18th birthday.</b>
      <div class="gap"></div>
      If you have a permanent physical or mental disability, or a disability
      expected to last more than two years or beyond age 18, you may become an
      Eagle Scout by qualifying for as many required merit badges as you can
      and qualifying for alternative merit badges for the rest. If you seek to
      become an Eagle Scout under this procedure, you must submit a special
      application to your local council service center. Your application must
      be approved by your council advancement committee before you can work on
      alternative merit badges.
      <div class="gap"></div>
      A Scout or Venturer with a disability may also qualify to work toward
      rank advancement after reaching 18 years of age if the guidelines
      outlined in section 10 of the <a
      href="https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/">Guide to
      Advancement</a> are met.
