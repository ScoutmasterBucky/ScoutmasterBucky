      <b>Prepare a Request for Alternative Requirements.</b> Once the Scout's best
      has been done to the limit of the Scout’s abilities and resources, the
      unit leader or a troop committee member submits to the council
      advancement committee a written request for alternative requirements for
      Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, or First Class ranks. It must show what
      has been completed and suggest the alternatives for those requirements
      the Scout cannot do.

      <b>Secure a Medical Statement and Provide Supporting Documents.</b> The
      request must be accompanied by supporting letters from the unit leader, a
      parent or guardian, and the Scout (if possible), as well as a written
      statement from a qualified health professional related to the nature of
      the disability. This may be, for example, a physician, neurologist,
      psychiatrist, psychologist, etc., or, when appropriate, an educational
      administrator in special education. Statements must describe the
      disability; cover the Scout’s capabilities, limitations, and prognosis;
      and outline what requirements cannot be completed. Additional information
      such as Individualized Education Plans (IEP) provided to parents by
      schools, and various treatment summaries and reports, may help an
      advancement committee make an informed decision.

      <b>The Advancement Committee Reviews the Request.</b> The advancement
      committee reviews the request, utilizing the expertise of professionals
      involved with youth who have special needs. To make a fair determination,
      the committee may want to interview the Scout, the Scout's parents(s) or
      guardian(s), and the unit leader. The committee's decision is then
      recorded and delivered to the Scout and the unit leader.
