                <br />
                A lever is a rigid bar that turns around a fulcrum, or fixed
                point. The force - a push or a pull that is applied to the
                lever - is called the effort. The farther the effort is from the
                fulcrum, the easier it is to use the lever. What the lever
                moves is called the load or the resistance. Levers can change
                the direction of motion, make it easier to move something, or
                cause something to move a greater distance. There are three
                classes, or types, of levers. Class 1 lever - The fulcrum is
                located between the effort and the load. The load always pushes
                down because of its weight. The force applied will push up on
                the load.<br />
                <br />
                In a class 1 lever, you push down. Even though you are pushing
                down because of its weight, the load will be lifted up. Also in
                a class 1 lever, you apply force in the direction opposite the
                direction you want the object to move. Depending on where the
                fulcrum is placed, a class 1 lever can make the load either
                move more easily or move a greater distance. Examples of class
                1 levers include seesaws, crowbars, scissors, and pliers.<br />
                <br />
                <img src="/nova-lab/cub-scouts/swing-class-1-lever.png" class="wide">
                <br />
                Class 2 lever - The fulcrum is at one end, the effort is at the
                other end, and the load is in the middle. The effort and the
                load move in the same direction. In a class 2 lever, the load
                pushes down, but you lift up to lift up the load. A class 2
                lever makes an object easier to move. Examples of class 2
                levers include wheelbarrows, catapults, bottle openers,
                screwdrivers, nutcrackers, staplers, and wheelbarrows.<br />

                <br />
                Class 3 lever - The fulcrum is at one end, and the effort is
                applied between the fulcrum and the load. In a class 3 lever,
                you push in the direction you want the load to move. A class 3
                lever makes an object harder to move but moves the object a
                much greater distance than the effort moves, such as a hammer
                driving a nail. Because the load end moves faster than the
                effort (it has to travel farther during the same amount of
                time), the load gains speed, such as swinging a baseball bat or
                golf club. Many sporting activities use class 3 levers, such as
                baseball bats, tennis rackets, canoe paddles, golf clubs, and
                fishing poles. Other examples of class 3 levers include the
                human arm, brooms, shovels, tweezers, and staple removers.<br />

                Bats, clubs, rackets, paddles, and fishing poles are class 3
                levers.

            <li>Make things easier to move - A small force applied over a large
            distance results in a large force moving a small distance (class 1
            levers where the applied force is farther away from the fulcrum
            than the load, and class 2 levers).</li>
            <li>Change the direction of the applied force (class 1 levers).</li>
            <li>Increase the distance an object moves - A large force applied over
            a small distance moves the load a large distance. (This happens
            with class 3 levers and class 1 levers where the fulcrum is closer
            to the applied force than the load.)</li>

            Visitations to places like carpentry shops, construction sites,
            restaurant kitchens, etc., will require advance planning by the
            counselor. The counselor should call ahead to make arrangements,
            and make plans to have appropriate supervision of all Scouts. The
            site will very likely have rules and instructions that must be
            followed. The counselor should help ensure that all the
            participants are aware of and follow those rules. This may include
            safety procedures and other instructions.
