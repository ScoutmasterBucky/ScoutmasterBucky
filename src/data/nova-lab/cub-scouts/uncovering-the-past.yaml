        <b>Option A:</b> Some of the objects archaeologists find have been
        preserved in various ways. Experiment with preserving a hot dog with
        baking soda. Measure each dimension, then completely surround and cover
        the hot dog in baking soda. Let sit in a safe place for seven days, and
        measure again. Then cover the hot dog again, let it sit another seven
        days, and measure it a third time. Make note of any changes in size,
        shape, color, and other properties. Compare it to a hot dog that has
        not been preserved. Discuss your experiment with your counselor.<br />
        <br />
        <b>Note: Do not eat the hot dog,</b> and make sure to store your
        experiment in a safe place and dispose of it properly when you are
        done.<br />

        <b>Option B:</b> Use plaster of paris to create a "rock" mold at least
        half an inch thick. Once it is set, create a dark surface like a patina
        on the rock, possibly by using tempera paint. Use a carving tool, such
        as a screw or push pin, to create one or more petroglyphs on your rock.<br />
        <br />
        Search online for "plaster of paris petroglyphs" for instructions.

        Discover the differences between physical remains, artifacts, and

            An <em>artifact</em> is any object made by a human being. Usually, it
            refers to an object that has cultural or historical interest.<br />
            <br />
            An <em>ecofact</em>, or <em>biofact</em>, is any organic material that has been
            recovered and has cultural or historical significance. This might
            be bones, animal horns, plants, and so on. If the item has been
            manipulated or modified by humans, it becomes an artifact.<br />
            <br />
            <em>Physical remains</em> are things left behind that were part of an
            animal - for example, body parts or fossils of body parts.

        Look around your home. Make a list of 10 artifacts from your home that

            Artifacts could include anything found lying around the Scout’s
            home. A dog crate could indicate the family has kept domesticated
            animals. A hammer could indicate they know how to use tools. Ask
            the Scouts to pretend they have never seen a particular item
            before, and what might they think it is.

        Much can be discovered about a group of people based on the items they
        throw away. With a parent or guardian’s permission and guidance, look
        through the items in a medium-sized trash can that contains at least a
        few days’ worth of trash. Draw conclusions about the people in that
        location and how they might live, based on what they throw away.
        Determine which items are artifacts and which are ecofacts. Discuss
        with your counselor how the relative age of the artifacts be estimated
        based on their location in the trash can.

            You may want to have the Scout wear disposable gloves, especially
            if the trash can contains food remains. The Scout could lay out a
            plastic tarp or sheet on the floor, then spread the trash out in
            order from what was at the top of the can to what was at the
            bottom. Can the Scout tell when one day ended and the next began?
            Is it possible to estimate how many days’ worth of trash there is?
            You could ask the Scout to take pictures and bring them to discuss
            with you.

        Create your own layers of artifacts and ecofacts. Gather some small
        items that would show future archaeologists how you and your family
        lived. Use a plastic bottle or glass jar as the vessel and Play-Doh
        sand, dirt, etc., to form layers. Place the gathered items in different
        layers. Think about which layers would hold the older items compared to
        newer ones. Show it to your counselor, and discuss with your counselor
        why you chose these items and what they would show archaeologists about
        how you lived. Excavate your items when you’re done.

    Visit a place that has items that have been excavated, such as a museum,
    dig site, historical society, etc. Talk to someone who works there about
    the displays. If you can’t visit in person, use resources in your school or
    local library or on the internet (with your parent's or guardian’s
    permission and guidance) to take a virtual visit. Discuss with your
    counselor what you saw, how the archaeologists helped uncover those items,
    and what questions you had.
