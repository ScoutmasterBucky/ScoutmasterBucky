            (cone-bearing tree with needles) in a cup of water and tightly
            fasten a clear plastic bag around the needles. Put a twig from a
            deciduous tree (leafy tree that loses its leaves in the fall) in a
            cup of water and tightly fasten a clear plastic bag around the
            leaves. Observe what happens and draw pictures of your

            What are the most common types of plants growing there? What
            animals did you see? Did you see, hear, or smell any evidence of
            other animals? (Your evidence might include things like bird calls,
            splashes of fish or frogs jumping, tracks, feathers, or bones.) How
            do aquatic ecosystems affect your life? How have humans affected
            the ecosystem? (Look for signs of humans such as trash and bridges
            or walkways.) How do you think humans have affected the ecosystem
            in ways you cannot see? (Think about fertilizer and pesticides
            washing off your lawn and flowing into a stream. How would this
            affect creatures that live in the water?) What can you do to
            improve the quality of the ecosystem?
