            Why do rockets have fins? Is there any connection between the
            feathers on arrows and fins on rockets?
        - detail: true

            Arrow feathers and rocket fins serve the same purpose—they provide aerodynamic stability during flight through the atmosphere.

            Why do some cars have spoilers? How do spoilers work?
        - detail: true
          text: |-
            In theory, spoilers on cars use Bernoulli’s principle in the
            opposite way that an airplane does. An airplane wing is designed
            for the air to flow faster over the top of it than under it; this
            is how it creates lift. A spoiler on a car is designed to force the
            air to move more quickly under the spoiler than over the spoiler;
            this pushes the car down to give the wheels more traction and
            increased stability. The faster the car goes, the faster the air
            moves under the spoiler and the more anti-lift is generated, which
            provides more stability.<br />
            <br />
            Without a spoiler, the only way to increase stability would be to
            increase the weight of the car. However, increasing the weight of
            the car increases its inertia, causing problems at corners and
            turns. Designers of spoilers have to balance the anti-lift with the
            drag created by using a spoiler.<br />

            If there is a creek or stream in your neighborhood, where does it

            With your parent’s or guardian’s permission and assistance, you may
            want to use an online mapping application to follow the streams and
            rivers to the ocean. Keep track of the names of the streams, lakes,
            and rivers connecting your stream to the ocean. Is it possible for
            you to find out the name of your watershed? Paddle-to-the-Sea by
            Holling C. Holling is a fun book on this topic.

            Is the creek or stream in your neighborhood or park polluted?
        - detail: true
          text: |-
            You can do a stream sample to find out what kinds of things are
            living in the water and under the rocks. Some things can survive
            in polluted water; others can live only in clean water. You can
            discover if a stream is polluted by finding out what lives there.<br />
            <br />
            Many states have stream studies based on macroinvertebrate
            identification and populations. Some states use data collected by
            volunteers for incorporation into stream quality reports. With
            permission from his parent or guardian, have your Scout check the
            Internet or with your state’s natural resources department for more
            information.<br />
