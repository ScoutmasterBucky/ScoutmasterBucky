            Find data on intervals (length of time) between eruptions for Old
            Faithful. Be aware that Old Faithfulâ€™s eruption behavior has
            changed over the years. Use the most current data you can find. For
            your analysis and to test your prediction strategy, you will need
            information on all of the intervals for three consecutive 24-hour
            periods, plus intervals for the fourth consecutive 24-hour period.
            Each additional youth must use intervals for different days.
