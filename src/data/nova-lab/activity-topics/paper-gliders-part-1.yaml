      Choose a glider design from a kit or plans. (You do not need to design
      the glider yourself.) Then do the following:

            Identify one quantitative characteristic to test, such as flight
            distance, flight time, average flight speed, and so on. Then
            identify one qualitative characteristic to test, such as presence
            of a stall, dive, flip, left turn, right turn, and so on.

            Hypothesize how variations in one part of the glider, such as wing
            size, fuselage length, center of gravity, flap size, and so on,
            might influence these characteristics of the glider's performance.

            Build four high-performance gliders, identical except for
            variations in the relevant glider part.

            Establish a consistent method to measure each characteristic during
            a test flight. Then find a way to launch the gliders in a
            consistent manner so that they are launched at the same speed every
            time. You should perform test flights with each model five to six
            times to account for variations in flight performance. Try to keep
            the conditions of each test flight the same as for all the other
            test flights. Keep records of the results for each test flight.
