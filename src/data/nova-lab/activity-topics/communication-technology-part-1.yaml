      Set up plans for how you will broadcast messages to various subgroups,
      how you will get emergency messages to groups or individuals who will
      have access to the contact information, how access will be maintained,
      and back-up plans in case you are suddenly unavailable.<br />
      <br />
      Think about the kinds of information you will need to communicate. This
      sometimes influences the mode of communication and should also be a part
      of your communication plans.

      Test your plan by playing a few Mad Libs via your communication plan. To
      test your communication plan, choose a particular Mad Lib and send out
      requests for various types of words (verbs, adjectives, nouns, and so on)
      to a group of individuals and subgroups. Make sure you cover your entire
      set of recipients or recipient groups, and be sure to give everyone a
      deadline for a response.<br />
      <br />
      If you don't get responses, follow up with additional messages, perhaps
      via different communication modes. When you have what you need, make sure
      you communicate the finished Mad Lib back to the relevant individuals.<br />
      <br />
      A Mad Lib is an unfinished story that is complete except for missing
      words, indicated by blanks. The words for each blank are in categories
      such asverbs, nouns, and adjectives. Missing words are supplied by folks
      who don't know the story, thus creating a funny, crazy, mad story.
