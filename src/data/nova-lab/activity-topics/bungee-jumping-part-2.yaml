      Create a scatter plot of ordered pairs of the type (number of rubber
      bands, average drop height). You may do this by hand or using data
      analysis software, such as Excel.
- requirement: 2
  text: |-
      Using the scatter plot you have created, determine whether the points
      appear to lie on or near a line. Find such a line. If your mathematics
      background is not yet extensive, then find such a line by "eyeballing it"
      and drawing it onto the scatter plot with a ruler. Otherwise use a
      graphing calculator or data analysis software of your choice to find the
      line of best fit for your data.

      Describe to your mentor how to use the line (graphical form or symbolic
      form) to make predictions. Then complete the following sentence
      (hypothesis): "If the height of the drop is _________________, then I
      predict that the number of rubber bands needed is _________________."

      Test your prediction and analyze the outcome. Determine whether the
      prediction matched reality, how far off the prediction was, and what
      errors or issues arose that may have thrown off the results of your
      simulation. Test and analyze three more predictions.
- requirement: 5

      Analyze the maximum errors found in your tests. Then find out the height
      of your favorite location (such as the Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower,
      or Golden Gate Bridge). If you drop your action figure from the top of
      that location, how many rubber bands would you need for a safe drop from
      that height? What would you expect to be the maximum error in your
      prediction?

      Now, consider the realities of bungee jumping with real human beings
      using real bungee cords and equipment. Discuss the following with your
      mentor:

            The factors that need to be considered when testing this equipment
            to develop safety protocols

            Reliable statistics on the risk of serious injury or death while
            bungee jumping

            Bungee jumping is one of the high-adventure activities that is
            expressly not allowed by the Scouting America. What do you
            think of this policy?

      Create a report addressed to the Risk Management Board of the Acme
      Daredevil Adventure Company. In your report, include the following:

            How your data led to your ability to make predictions about safe
            bungee jumping heights
