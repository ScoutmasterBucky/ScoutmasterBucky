      Develop your own design for a product that can be made by recycling or
      repurposing other items. The items being recycled or repurposed should
      form the bulk of the new product. For instance, avoid designs that are 5
      percent recycled and 95 percent new materials. Use ONE of the following
      two approaches.

            Find an item that isn't environmentally friendly, doesn't break
            down easily, and is typically thrown away. Invent a new product
            that would repurpose that item. The recycling of tires into road
            surfacing material and into playground mulch is an example of this
            approach.

            Think of an often-used product that is typically made with all-new
            materials. Develop a way to make that product out of recycled or
            repurposed materials. (The production of paper grocery bags made
            from recycled paper instead of "new" paper is an example of this
            approach.)

      Summarize design specifications of the product you invented for
      requirement 1, and create a drawing, model, or prototype. What resources
      would be needed to carry out a large-scale production of your invention?
      Speculate on the environmental impact of using your product over a
      comparable product made with all-new materials. Create a report that
      includes your design specifications, photos or illustrations, a summary
      of how your product can be mass produced, and a case for the
      environmental soundness of your product.
