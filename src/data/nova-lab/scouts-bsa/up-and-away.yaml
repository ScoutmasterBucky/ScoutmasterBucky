                  The study of fluid dynamics can include both liquids and
                  gases. On Earth, two of the most common are air and water.
                  With your parents’ permission or working with your counselor,
                  look at how a golf ball or other sphere would travel through
                  the air and through water. What would be the standard
                  equations for a sphere to travel through air? Through water?
                  What is the key difference between the two? Remember both
                  are fluids.

                  Drop a sphere from a height of between one and two feet in

                  on what you have to hold water since you want the height to

                  Using an egg would test the survivability of the system given
                  the nature of an egg. To reduce mess and complexity you may
                  want to use a hard boiled egg which will show damage but not
