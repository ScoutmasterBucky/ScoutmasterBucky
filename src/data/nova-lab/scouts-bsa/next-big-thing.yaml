            Explore product innovation<br />
            <br />
            Examine one product and at least two different versions of that
            product. Create a list of the differences between the designs.
            Discuss with your counselor the differences and what you think each
            difference is trying to solve.

            Research prototyping methods<br />
            <br />
            Find and explain the differences between a "works-like" and
            "looks-like" prototype. Learn the reasons and applications where
            one method would be chosen over the other. Research different ways
            and costs of having a product professionally prototyped. Explore
            the reasons why one method would be chosen over another. Discuss
            and explain your findings with your counselor
      - requirement: C

            Market research<br />
            <br />
            Research and understand the terms: market size, business plan,
            value proposition, elevator pitch, cost-effective design, and
            ethnographic research - specifically, in reference to product
            design. Discuss with your counselor what these terms mean and why
            they are important for a product designer to understand, and how
            they affect the design of a product.

        text: |-
            Practice brainstorming<br />
            <br />
            Examine different brainstorming methods. Choose a product you have
            used or a situation you have experienced. Using one method you
            found, brainstorm various ways to improve the product or situation.
            You do not have to brainstorm designs, just ways to improve the
            design. Present your list to your counselor and discuss.
      - requirement: E
        text: |-
            Learn about and practice "Painstorming"<br />
            <br />
            Research "painstorming": what it is and how it is done? Choose a
            product you have used or a situation you have experienced and
            "painstorm" for at least 15 minutes. Do not think of designs to
            solve the pains, just list as many pains as you can. Present your
            list of pains to your counselor and discuss.

            iterations their product went through before it became successful.
