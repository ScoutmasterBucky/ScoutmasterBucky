                  Integer – a variable that holds only whole numbers (e.g., 56,

                  A function is a block of instructions which computes a result
                  and returns the result to the calling program. A program can
                  branch to (or call) the function and then return back to
                  where the function was called when the function completes. A
                  function typically computes equations needed in multiple
                  places in the program. (e.g., a function to calculate a

                  A Key/Value pair in database programming is a set of two
                  linked data elements which allow the programmer to use a
                  first key data element to find a result value based on the
