            Calculate your horsepower when you run up a flight of stairs.

            - detail: true
              text: |-
                  Horsepower is a unit of power. One horsepower equals 33,000
                  foot-pounds of work per minute, or 745.6 watts. James Watt,
                  who invented steam engines, based his unit of power on how
                  much weight a real horse could pull from a coal mine in one
                  minute. See "What Is Horsepower" at

                  <ul>
                  <li>Find out how much you weigh in kilograms and write it down.
                  (Multiply your weight in pounds by 0.454 to get kilograms.)</li>
                  <li>Find a stair, ladder, or something similar (as long as it gets
                  you upward).</li>
                  <li>Measure the height (not the length) of the stairs (or whatever
                  you use) from the bottom to the ending point at the top and write
                  it down. This can be done by multiplying the height of one stair by
                  the number of stairs (it doesn't matter how long the stairs are).</li>
                  <li>Take a running start toward the stairs. When you step on the
                  first step, start the timer; when both feet are on the top step,
                  stop the timer. (You may skip stairs.) Now you have all the numbers
                  needed.</li>
                  <li>Calculate the Power (P) with this formula: <var>mah/t (m*9.80*h)/t</var>,
                  where:
                      <ul>

                      <li><var>h</var> = height of staircase in meters</li>
                      <li><var>t</var> = time in seconds</li>
                      </ul>
                      The number you get is in watts, which is equal to joules per
                      second (J/s) and newton meters per second (Nm/s). If you don't
                      divide by time, you will calculate the energy needed to climb
                      the stairs.
                      <ul>
                      <li>Work = mah</li>
                      <li>Power = mah/t</li>
                      </ul>
                      Work (or energy) is measured in newton meters or joules; power
                      is measured in joules/second or watts.</li>
                  <li>Divide the number of watts by 745.6 w/hp to get the number in
                  horsepower.</li>

            a graph? Will a graphing calculator always show the entire graph or
            does it sometimes show only a portion of the graph? If it shows
            only a portion of the graph, how can you be certain that the
            portion you are viewing shows the features you want to see?</li>
            <li>For numerical calculations, when does your calculator give exact
            answers and when does it give approximate answers? What is the
            difference? How can you tell? Does it matter?</li>
            <li>If your calculator defaults to giving you an approximate answer,
            but you need an exact answer, what do you do?</li>
            <li>If an approximate answer will do, how might your calculator's
            internal calculation limitations affect the accuracy of the
            approximation?</li>
            <li>For a calculator with graphing capabilities, how might pixel
            limitations affect its depiction of a graph?</li>
            <li>Is the calculator always right? Why or why not? How might you
            tell? What might cause a calculator to give you an incorrect
            answer? (For a graphing calculator, what might cause the calculator
            to give you an incorrect graph, no graph, or a graph that cannot be
            readily interpreted?)</li>
            <li>Are there numerical calculations that calculators can't do? If
            possible, give an example.</li>
            </ul>
