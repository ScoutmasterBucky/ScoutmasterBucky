                        What is the science of genetics? The fields of genetics
                        and genomics offer dozens of career possibilities.
                        Which are the three most interesting to you?

                        possible environmental factors cause genetic mutations
                        in humans?

                  Study at least four diverse environmental areas near where
                  you live. Plan and execute a field trip to each of these
                  areas, with the permission of your parents or guardians and
                  your counselor.

                        interact with them, and a list of what plants, animals,

                        different species in your analysis and how they have
                        changed over time. Discuss both biological and physical
                        components.

                        approved by your counselor in one of the four
                        identified environmental areas. Make sure to inventory
                        and map the area, and to observe the living and
