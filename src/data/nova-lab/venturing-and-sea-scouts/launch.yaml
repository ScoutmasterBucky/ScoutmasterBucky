                              When an object is fired, launched, or thrown, it
                              is given horizontal velocity. (Velocity is the
                              same as speed, but it is speed in a given
                              direction.) Once the object is launched, no
                              additional force providing horizontal velocity is
                              applied. Newton’s First Law of Motion states that
                              a body at rest stays at rest and a body in motion
                              stays in motion unless acted upon by an outside
                              force. If gravity did not act on the projectile’s
                              path, the object would continue to move in the
                              direction in which it was launched. Once the
                              object has been launched, the only force acting
                              upon it is the force of gravity, which
                              accelerates the object toward Earth.<br />

                              Projectile motion is caused by the force of
                              gravity giving vertical acceleration to an object
                              that has horizontal velocity. (When an object is
                              thrown straight up in the air, the force of
                              gravity slows it down, it comes momentarily to a
                              complete stop, then it accelerates downward.) An
                              object that has been launched will continue to
                              move in the direction it was thrown at the speed
                              with which it was thrown, except for being slowed
                              down by friction with the air (air resistance),
                              but it will begin to accelerate toward Earth,
                              moving faster toward Earth all the time. The
                              combination of constant horizontal velocity and
                              increasing downward velocity due to the
                              acceleration of gravity is what gives a
                              projectile its curved path.<br />

                              Forward velocity is the speed horizontal to Earth
                              given to a projectile. If the projectile is
                              thrown parallel to Earth, all of its original
                              speed will be its forward velocity. If an object
                              is thrown at an angle to Earth, the forward
                              velocity is that portion of the velocity that is
                              parallel to Earth.<br />
                              <br />
                              (Determining forward velocity can be done by
                              separating the velocity into horizontal and
                              vertical components - like on a triangle - using
                              vector resolution.)<br />

                              Forward velocity has a constant speed.<br />
                              <br />
                              Acceleration due to gravity slows down things
                              that are moving upward and speeds up things that
                              are moving downward. At most locations on Earth,
                              the acceleration of gravity (9.80 m/s², or
                              ~32.174 ft/s²) will cause an object to fall 9.8
                              meters per second faster each second. An object
                              starting with no vertical motion will be falling
                              toward Earth at the rate of 9.8 m/s at the end of
                              one second and at the rate of 19.6 m/s at the end
                              of two seconds. Acceleration due to gravity is
                              constantly changing the vertical speed / velocity
                              of an object.

                        Escape velocity is the speed at which an object will be
                        able to escape the gravity of Earth, the moon, or other
                        body. An object must travel fast enough that it will
                        not fall back to the surface. Escape velocity from
                        Earth is 11.2 km/s, or 25038.72 mph. Escape velocity is
                        proportional to the square root of the ratio between
                        the mass of the larger body and the distance of the
                        smaller object from the center of the larger body.<br />

                        Orbital velocity is achieved when an object’s
                        horizontal velocity balances the acceleration of
                        gravity at that location in space. An object that has
                        orbital velocity (is in orbit) continues to fall toward
                        Earth as it travels away from Earth, giving the object
                        a circular path around Earth. The object continually
                        falls around Earth due to the combination of horizontal
                        velocity and acceleration due to gravity.<br />

                        Terminal velocity is the point at which the
                        acceleration of gravity on an object matches the air
                        resistance of the object. Terminal velocity is affected
                        by the weight of the object and its orientation. (The
                        more surface area that is horizontal to Earth, the
                        lower the terminal velocity. Skydivers who perform
                        aerial displays use this fact. The first divers to jump
                        lie flat to increase their air resistance. Later
                        divers streamline dive by holding their arms and legs
                        tightly to their bodies and dive headfirst toward Earth
                        in order to catch the earlier divers in the air.)<br />
                        <br />
                        Note: If it were not for air resistance, all objects,
                        regardless of mass, size, or any other factor, would
                        fall at the SAME velocity.<br />

                        When satellites are launched to the east, Earth’s spin
                        effectively adds to their velocity, making escape
                        velocity easier to obtain and requiring less fuel. Not
                        all spacecraft are launched toward the east; the launch
                        direction depends also on the final orbit and purpose
                        of the satellite. In order for a spacecraft to
                        rendezvous with another spacecraft or other object in
                        space, the orbits of both objects must be taken into
                        consideration. A launch window describes a time period
                        in which a mission must be launched for the objects’
                        orbits to overlap.

                  What is the average terminal velocity of a skydiver? (What is
                  the fastest you would go if you were to jump out of an

                        Terminal velocity is when the acceleration due to
                        gravity is matched by the air resistance (or resistance
                        of whatever fluid the object is traveling through).
                        When the acceleration of gravity is balanced by air
                        resistance, the object continues to fall, but it does
                        not increase its velocity.<br />
