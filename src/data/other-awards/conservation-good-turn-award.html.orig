  <p>
    Since 1910, conservation has been an integral part of the program of
    Scouting America. Scouting America has been a positive force in conservation
    and environmental efforts. Scouts have rendered distinguished public service
    by helping to conserve wildlife, energy, forests, soil, and water. Past
    generations of Scouts have been widely recognized for undertaking
    conservation Good Turn action projects in their local communities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Scouts of today have grown up hearing words such as ecosystem, biodiversity,
    and climate change. They recognize the need for, and the benefits of,
    conserving natural resources. Scouts understand that we all must work
    together for the betterment of the land, forests, wildlife, air, and water.
  </p>
  <p>
    Much has been accomplished in recent years by individual Scouts and through
    unit conservation Good Turns. Much more needs to be done.
  </p>
  <h2>To Earn The Conservation Good Turn Award</h2>
  <p>
    The Conservation Good Turn Award is an opportunity for Cub Scout packs,
    Scout troops and Venturing crews to join with conservation or environmental
    organizations (federal, state, local, or private) to carry out a
    conservation Good Turn in their home communities, camp properties, or on
    public lands.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The Scouting unit contacts a conservation organization, (or land manager,
      Camp Ranger or other appropriate official) and offers to carry out a
      Conservation Good Turn project.
    </li>
    <li>
      The conservation organization identifies a worthwhile and needed project
      that the unit can accomplish.
    </li>
    <li>
      Working together, the unit and the conservation organization plan the
      details and establish the date, time, and location for carrying out the
      project.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Scout, Venturer, Sea Scout or Cub Scout earns the Conservation Good
      Turn Award by participating in the planned conservation project to the
      satisfaction of the unit leader.&#160; Projects can be conducted in
      partnership with any conservation organization, land management agency,
      Council Conservation Committee, Camp Ranger or Ecology Program at a Scout
      Camp or Scouting Event.&#160; Working with the unit to assist a Scout, Sea
      Scout or Venturer who is working to complete an approved Scouting America
      Distinguished Conservation Service Award project is a suitable opportunity
      for earning the Conservation Good Turn Award.

  </p>
  <h2>Recognitions</h2>
  <p>
    A Conservation Good Turn certificate is available at the council service
    center for units that participate and report on their efforts. A
    Conservation Good Turn patch is also available for purchase at the council
    service center to recognize individual youth and adult members who
    participate in a meaningful conservation project.
  </p>
  <h2>Project Ideas</h2>
  <p>
    Conservation and environmental organizations typically have a backlog of
    needed projects that they have been unable to carry out for lack of funding
    or volunteers. The list of possible Good Turn projects is limited only by
    the needs of the conservation organization and the willingness of the
    Scouting unit. In every community, whether urban, suburban, or rural,
    worthwhile projects await all Scouting units.
