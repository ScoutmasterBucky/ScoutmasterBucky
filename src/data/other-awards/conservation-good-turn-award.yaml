      The Scout, Venturer, Sea Scout or Cub Scout earns the Conservation Good
      Turn Award by participating in the planned conservation project to the
      satisfaction of the unit leader. Projects can be conducted in partnership
      with any conservation organization, land management agency, Council
      Conservation Committee, Camp Ranger or Ecology Program at a Scout Camp or
      Scouting Event. Working with the unit to assist a Scout, Sea Scout or
      Venturer who is working to complete an approved Scouting America
      Distinguished Conservation Service Award project is a suitable
      opportunity for earning the Conservation Good Turn Award.
