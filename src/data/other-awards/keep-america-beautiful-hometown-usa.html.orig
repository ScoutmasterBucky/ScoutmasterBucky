  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p>
    Keep America Beautiful was founded in 1953 with the purpose of building and
    sustaining a national cleanliness ethic. Scouting America has been
    affiliated with Keep America Beautiful for more than 50 years at the
    national level and through KAB’s national network of more than 600 community
    affiliates.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1971, Scouting Keep America Beautiful Day was first cosponsored by KAB
    and Scouting America as a massive national cleanup and recycling program.
    Millions of Scouts still turn out annually to participate in
    community-enriching activities such as the Great American Cleanup and
    America Recycles Day.
  </p>
  <h4>Requirements</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Merit badges.</strong> Earn three merit badges from the
        following list of 13 (*required for Eagle): Citizenship in the
        Community*, Communication*, Energy, Environmental Science*, Fish and
        Wildlife Management, Forestry, Gardening, Geocaching, Landscape
        Architecture, Photography, Public Speaking, Soil and Water Conservation,
        Sustainability*.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Community service project.</strong> In addition to earning the
        merit badges, a Scout is required to perform a community service
        project. The project should involve a minimum of eight hours of time,
        two of which must involve management planning, with the other six
        consisting of carrying out the project. It should help keep America
        beautiful and benefit the community either physically or financially.
        One way to do this is to plan the community service project as part of a
        Keep America Beautiful program. See some examples below.

  <h4>Getting the Patch</h4>

    Scouts must complete the Hometown U.S.A. Award application form and present
    it to their unit leader or unit advancement chairperson.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to qualify for the award, Scouts must have successfully completed
    the requirements as outlined. The unit advancement chairperson will know
    which merit badges each Scout needs in order to qualify.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is suggested that the community service project be under the overall
    direction of a natural resources professional or other qualified adult
    supervisor. After completing the project, the adult supervisor should sign a
    statement that the project has been completed and meets the requirements of
    the project sponsor.
