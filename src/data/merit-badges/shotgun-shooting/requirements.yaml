                  Shooting score required: Hit at least 12 out of 25 targets (48
                  percent) in two 25-target groups. The two groups need not be shot

                      Targets may be thrown by a hand trap, manual mechanical trap, or on
                      any trap or skeet field. If using a hand trap or manual mechanical
                      trap, the trap operator should be at least 5 feet to the right and 3
                      feet to the rear of the shooter. If throwing left-handed with a hand
                      trap, the trap operator should be at least 5 feet to the left and 3
                      feet to the rear of the shooter.

                      Targets should be generally thrown so as to climb in the air after
                      leaving the trap.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Scores may be fired at any time, either in formal competition or in

                      not be used in Scouting America range and target activities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Shooters must shoot in rounds of 25. Rounds need not be shot
                      continuously or on the same day. The term "round" refers to a single
                      series of 25 shots.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If using a trap field, shoot station 3 with traps set to throw
                      straightaway targets.
