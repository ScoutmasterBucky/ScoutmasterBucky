        (a) Make one of the following instruments: wind vane, anemometer, rain
        gauge, hygrometer. Keep a daily weather log for one week using
        information from this instrument as well as from other sources such as

        speed, temperature, precipitation, and types of clouds. Be sure to make
        a note of any morning dew or frost. In the log, also list the weather
        forecasts from radio or television at the same time each day and show
