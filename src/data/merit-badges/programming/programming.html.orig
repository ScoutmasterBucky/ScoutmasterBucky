      <strong>Project.</strong> With your counselor's guidance, select three
      different programming languages and development environments. For each
      sub-requirement below, do the following: Write or modify a program using
      the indicated programming language and development environment. The
      program must take input and produce output based on computations and
      decisions made on the input. Debug and demonstrate the program to your
      counselor. Explain how each program processes inputs, makes decisions
      based on those inputs, and provides outputs based on computations and
      decision making.
