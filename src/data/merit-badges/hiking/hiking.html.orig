      Take four 10-mile hikes and one 20-mile hike, each on a different day, and
      each of continuous miles. Prepare a written hike plan before each hike and
      share it with your counselor or a designee for approval before starting
      the hike. Include map routes, a clothing and equipment list, and a list of
      items for a trail lunch. You may stop for as many short rest periods as
      needed, as well as one meal, during each hike, but not for an extended
      period such as overnight. <br /><i>Resource:</i>

      After each of the hikes (or during each hike if on one continuous trek) in
      requirement 4, write a short report on your hike. For each hike, give the
      date and description (or map) of the route covered, the weather, any
      interesting things you saw, and any challenges you had and how you
      overcame them. It may include something you learned about yourself, about
      the outdoors, or about others you were hiking with. Share this with your
      counselor.
