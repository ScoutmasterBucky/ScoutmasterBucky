      in requirement 4, write a short report on your hike. For each hike, give
      the date and description (or map) of the route covered, the weather, any
      interesting things you saw, and any challenges you had and how you overcame
      them. It may include something you learned about yourself, about the
      outdoors, or about others you were hiking with. Share this with your
      counselor.
