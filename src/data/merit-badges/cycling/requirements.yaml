                  On mountain biking or multi-use trails approved by your counselor,
                  take two rides of 2 miles each, two rides of 5 miles each, and two
                  rides of 8 miles each. You must make a report of the rides taken.
                  List dates for the routes traveled, and interesting things seen.

                  After fulfilling the previous requirement, lay out on a trail map a
                  22-mile trip. You may include multiple trail systems, if needed.
                  Stay away from main highways. Using your map, complete this ride in
