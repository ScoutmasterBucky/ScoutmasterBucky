      <b>Planning Your Project. </b>With your counselor's advice, select a

      <b>Build Your Model.</b> Do ONE of the following using physical and/or
      computer design methods. Before beginning any model, discuss your approach
      with your counselor, including the possible use of computer design
      software such as CAD or 3D modeling tools. Present your plans and
      completed model to your counselor.

      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-14880 mb-requirement-id-14881">
        (a) <b>Architectural Model. </b><br />
        Design and build a model of a house to a scale of 1⁄4" = 1'0" (1:48
        scale). Begin by creating floor plans and elevations. Include windows,
        doors, and structural elements. Discuss with your counselor the
        materials you intend to use, the amount of detail required, outside
        treatment (finish, shrubbery, walks, etc.), and color selections. You
        may choose to 3D print elements or use laser-cut parts based on using
        computer design. Present both your design and final model to your
        counselor for evaluation.

      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-14880 mb-requirement-id-14882">
        (b) <b>Structural Model.</b> <br />
        Construct a scale model showing corner construction of a wood-frame
        building to a scale of 1 1⁄2"=1'0" (1:8 scale). Begin with a structural
        layout showing the parts of the floor and wall frames, such as
        intermediate girder, joist, bridging, subfloor, sill, sole plate, stud,
        and rafter. Use your plans to assist in building a physical model with
        cardboard, foam board, or wood. Review with your counselor the parts of
        the structure and discuss challenges in both your design and build
        process, gathering the materials and supporting the structure.

      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-14880 mb-requirement-id-14883">
        (c) <b>Process Model. </b><br />
        Design and build a model showing the plumbing system of your house to a
        scale of 3 ⁄4" =1'0" (1:16 scale) or an agreed upon scale. Show hot and
        cold-water supply, all waste returns, and venting. After creating your
        plan, talk to your counselor about how to begin this model, and present
        the scale and the materials you will use. Build the model using
        appropriate materials such as tubing, straws, or printed parts. After
        completion, present your model to your counselor, and be prepared to
        discuss any problems you had building this model.

        <b>Mechanical Model.</b>
        Build a model of a mechanical device that incorporates at least two of
        the six simple machines. You can use digital tools to design and
        simulate the device before constructing it. Once your design is approved
        by your counselor, build a working physical model using materials such
        as wood, plastic, or 3D printed parts. Present your models to your
        counselor and be prepared to discuss materials used, the machine's
        function, and challenges you encountered during the construction
        process.

        (e) <b>Industrial Model. </b><br />
        Build a model of an actual passenger-carrying vehicle to a scale of 1" =
        1'0" or 1 ⁄2" = 1'0" (1:12 or 1:24 scale). Begin by measuring a real
        vehicle and modeling it from multiple views (top, front, rear, sides).
        You can draw it or use computer design software. From your plans, build
        a physical model or use digital rendering or 3D printing to produce the
        final version. Discuss with your counselor which parts were most
        challenging.
