            <b>Architectural Model.</b>
            <div class="gap"></div>
            Design and build a model of a house to a scale of 1⁄4" = 1'0" (1:48
            scale). Begin by creating floor plans and elevations. Include windows,
            doors, and structural elements. Discuss with your counselor the
            materials you intend to use, the amount of detail required, outside
            treatment (finish, shrubbery, walks, etc.), and color selections. You
            may choose to 3D print elements or use laser-cut parts based on using
            computer design. Present both your design and final model to your
            counselor for evaluation.

            Construct a scale model showing corner construction of a wood-frame
            building to a scale of 1 1⁄2" = 1'0" (1:8 scale). Begin with a structural
            layout showing the parts of the floor and wall frames, such as
            intermediate girder, joist, bridging, subfloor, sill, sole plate, stud,
            and rafter. Use your plans to assist in building a physical model with
            cardboard, foam board, or wood. Review with your counselor the parts of
            the structure and discuss challenges in both your design and build
            process, gathering the materials and supporting the structure.

            scale of 3⁄4" = 1'0" (1:16 scale) or an agreed upon scale. Show hot and
            cold-water supply, all waste returns, and venting. After creating your
            plan, talk to your counselor about how to begin this model, and present
            the scale and the materials you will use. Build the model using
            appropriate materials such as tubing, straws, or printed parts. After

            simulate the device before constructing it. Once your design is approved
            by your counselor, build a working physical model using materials such
            as wood, plastic, or 3D printed parts. Present your models to your
            counselor and be prepared to discuss materials used, the machine's
            function, and challenges you encountered during the construction
            process.
