            Take custody of one or more reptiles or amphibians in a manner approved
            by your counselor. Maintain one or more reptiles or amphibians for at
            least a month. Record food accepted, eating methods, changes in
            coloration, shedding of skins, and general habits; or keep the eggs of
            a reptile from the time of laying until hatching; or keep the eggs of
            an amphibian from the time of laying until their transformation into
            tadpoles (frogs) or larvae (salamanders). Whichever you chose, keep
            records of and report to your counselor how you cared for your
            animal/eggs/larvae to include lighting, habitat, temperature and
            humidity maintenance and any veterinary care requirements. Unless you
            are the long-term owner, at the conclusion of this study, turn the
            animal(s) over to another responsible party approved by your counselor.

            (b) Choose a reptile or amphibian that you can observe or foster at a
            local zoo, aquarium, nature center, local rescue, or other such exhibit
            (such as your classroom or school). Study the specimen weekly for a
            period of three months. At each visit, sketch the specimen in its
            captive habitat and note any changes in its coloration, shedding of
            skins, and general habits and behavior. Discuss with your counselor how
            the animal you observed was cared for to include its housing and
            habitat, how the lighting, temperature, and humidity were maintained,
            and any veterinary care requirements. Find out, either from information
            you locate on your own or by talking to the caretaker, what this species
            eats and what are its native habitat and home range, preferred climate,
            average life expectancy, and natural predators. Also, identify any
            human-caused threats to its population and any laws that protect the
            species and its habitat. After the observation period, share what you
            have learned with your counselor.
