            coloration, shedding of skins, and general habits; or keep the eggs of
            a reptile from the time of laying until hatching; or keep the eggs of
            an amphibian from the time of laying until their transformation into
            tadpoles (frogs) or larvae (salamanders). Whichever you chose, keep
            records of and report to your counselor how you cared for your
            animal/eggs/larvae to include lighting, habitat, temperature and
            humidity maintenance and any veterinary care requirements. Unless you

            (such as your classroom or school). Study the specimen weekly for a
            period of three months. At each visit, sketch the specimen in its
            captive habitat and note any changes in its coloration, shedding of
            skins, and general habits and behavior. Discuss with your counselor how
            the animal you observed was cared for to include its housing and
            habitat, how the lighting, temperature, and humidity were maintained,
            and any veterinary care requirements.

            expectancy, and natural predators. Also, identify any human-caused
            threats to its population and any laws that protect the species and
            its habitat. After the observation period, share what you have
