        >Note: Scouts must not use venomous reptiles in fulfilling requirement
        8(a). When you decide that keeping your specimen is no longer possible
        or desired, be sure to find another appropriate home for it or return it
        to the wild at the location of capture. Check with your counselor for
        those instances where the return of these specimens would not be
        appropriate. <br />
        <br />Under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, some plants and animals

        may be protected by state law. Be sure that you do not collect protected
        species. <br /><br />Your state may require that you purchase and carry
        a license to collect certain species. Check with the wildlife and fish
        and game officials in your state regarding species regulations before
        you begin to collect.</b

        coloration, shedding of skins, and general habits; or keep the eggs of a
        reptile from the time of laying until hatching; or keep the eggs of an

        humidity maintenance and any veterinary care requirements. Unless you

        period of three months. At each visit, sketch the specimen in its

        average life expectancy, and natural predators. <br /><br />
        Also, identify any human-caused threats to its population and any laws
