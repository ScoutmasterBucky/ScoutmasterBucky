      Scouting America swimmer test: Jump feetfirst into water over the head in
      depth. Level off and swim 75 yards in a strong manner using one or more of
      the following strokes: sidestroke, breaststroke, trudgen, or crawl; then
      swim 25 yards using an easy, resting backstroke. The 100 yards must be
