        (a) With your parent or guardian's and counselor's permission and
        approval, arrange to meet with an architect. Ask to see the scale model
        of a building and the drawings that a builder would use to construct
        this building. Discuss why the different building materials were
        selected. Look at the details in the drawings and the model to see how
        the materials and components are attached to each other during
        construction.

        <br /><br /><b>Note:</b> To visit a construction site will require
        advance planning. You will need permission from your parents, counselor,
        the architect, and the construction site manager. A construction site is
        a very dangerous place. While there, you will need to closely follow the
        site manager's directions and comply with all the safety procedures,
        including wearing a hard hat, protective eyewear, and proper footwear.
        Be aware of the changing conditions at the site, and stay with the
        architect or site manager. <br /><br />

        building. Write a short program including a list of requirements for the
        project, the functions of the building and site, how the functions
        relate to one another, and the goals of the project.
