        count toward rank advancement or other merit badges. Meals prepared for

        Outdoor Cooking: Where local regulations do not allow you to build a
        fire, the counselor may adjust the requirement to meet the law. The
        meals in requirements 5 and 6 may be prepared for different trips and
        need not be prepared consecutively. Scouts working on this badge in
        summer camp should take into consideration foods that can be obtained at

    <ul class="mb-requirement-children-list">
      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-12864 mb-requirement-id-12865">
        (a) Using the MyPlate food guide or the current USDA nutrition model,
        plan a day of meals for trail hiking or backpacking that includes one
        breakfast, one lunch, one dinner, and one snack. These meals must
        consider weight, not require refrigeration and are to be consumed by
        three to five people (including you). List the equipment and utensils
        needed to prepare and serve these meals. <br /><i>Resource:</i>

        needed to prepare and serve each meal, and the cost for each meal.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-12864 mb-requirement-id-12867">
        (c) Share and discuss your menu and shopping list with your counselor.
        Your plan must include how to repackage foods for your hike or
        backpacking trip to eliminate as much bulk, weight, and garbage as
        possible. <br /><i>Resource:</i>

        (d) While on a trail hike or backpacking trip, prepare and serve two
        meals and a snack from the menu planned for this requirement. At least
        one of those meals must be cooked over a fire, or an approved trail
        stove (with proper supervision). <br /><i>Resource:</i>

        (e) After each meal, have those you served evaluate the meal on
        presentation and taste, then evaluate your own meal. Discuss what you
        learned with your counselor, including any adjustments that could have
        improved or enhanced your meals. Tell how planning and preparation help
        ensure successful trail hiking or backpacking meals.

      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-12864 mb-requirement-id-12870">
        (f) Explain to your counselor how you should divide the food and cooking
        supplies among the patrol in order to share the load. Discuss how to
        properly clean the cooking area and store your food to protect it from
        animals. <br /><i>Resource:</i>
