        Outdoor Cooking: Where local regulations do not allow you to build a

        meals in requirements 5 and 6 may be prepared for different trips and
        need not be prepared consecutively. Scouts working on this badge in
        summer camp should take into consideration foods that can be obtained at
        the camp commissary.</b
