            Identify how you might use the skills and knowledge in cooking to
            pursue a personal hobby or healthy lifestyle. Research the additional
            training required, expenses, and affiliation with organizations that
            would help you maximize the enjoyment and benefit you might gain from
            it. Discuss what you learned with your counselor and share what
            short-term and long-term goals you might have if you pursued this.
