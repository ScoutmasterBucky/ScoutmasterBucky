            Identify how you might use the skills and knowledge in sewing
            and/or needlework to pursue a personal hobby. Research the
            additional training required, expenses, and affiliation with
            organizations that would help you maximize the enjoyment and
            benefit you might gain from it. Discuss what you learned with your
