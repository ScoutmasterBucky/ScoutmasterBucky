      <strong>Project.</strong> With your counselor's guidance, select three
      different programming languages and development environments. For each
      sub-requirement below, do the following: Write or modify a program using
      the indicated programming language and development environment. The
      program must take input and produce output based on computations and
      decisions made on the input. Debug and demonstrate the program to your
      counselor. Explain how each program processes inputs, makes decisions
      based on those inputs, and provides outputs based on computations and
      decision making.

    <ul class="mb-requirement-children-list">
      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-13136 mb-requirement-id-13137">
        (a) In the first language and environment, write or modify a program,
        debug and demonstrate, and explain as above. <br /><br />
        With your counselor's approval, choose a sample program. Modify the code
        or add a function or subroutine to it. Debug and demonstrate the
        modified program to your counselor. The Programming merit badge website,
        <a href="http://www.scoutlife.org/programming"
          >www.scoutlife.org/programming</a
        >, has a number of sample programs that you could use for requirement 5.
        However, you have the option of finding a program on your own. It's a
        good idea to seek your counselor's guidance.

      <strong>Careers.</strong> Find out about three career opportunities that
      require knowledge in programming. Pick one and find out the education,
      training, and experience required. Discuss this with your counselor and
      explain why this career might be of interest to you.
