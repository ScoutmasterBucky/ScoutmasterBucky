      After completing requirement 1, discuss the following with your counselor:
    </div>
    <ul class="mb-requirement-children-list">
      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-7198 mb-requirement-id-7199">
        (a) Tell whether the design had separate spaces, a defined point of
        entry, a clear path system, and sun and shade variety.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-7198 mb-requirement-id-7200">
        (b) Discuss how any structures, the designated seating, eating, or
        parking areas suited the overall design.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-7198 mb-requirement-id-7201">
        (c) Explain how the design reflected consideration for the comfort,
        shelter, andsecurity of the users.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-7198 mb-requirement-id-7202">
        (d) Discuss how the choice of trees, shrubs, and ground covers used in
        the project contributed to its appeal and function.

      Identify five shrubs, five trees, and one ground cover, being sure that
      you select examples of different shapes, sizes, and textures. With the
      help of your counselor or a local nursery, choose plants that will grow in
      your area. Bring pictures of the different planting materials or, if
      possible, examples of their branches, leaves, or flowers to a group such
      as your troop or class at school. Be prepared to tell how you might use
      each in the design of a landscape and the maintenance that would follow.

      After obtaining permission from the appropriate authority, look at and
      study a place of worship, school grounds, or a public building and
      identify where most people arrive by bus or car. Then do the following:
    </div>
    <ul class="mb-requirement-children-list">
      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-7203 mb-requirement-id-7204">
        (a) Using a measuring tape, measure and draw the main site entry and its
        nearby area. Define the scale of your drawing. Be sure to include the
        driveway and sidewalk or path that leads to the building's main entry.
        Indicate any sidewalks, structures, trees and plants, lights, drains,
        utilities, or other site furnishings within the study area. Make two
        copies of this plan and save the original, then do 4b and 4c using the
        copies.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-7203 mb-requirement-id-7205">
        (b) On one copy of your site plan, use directional arrows to indicate
        where the water drains across the site, where ditches occur, and where
        water stands for a longer period of time.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-7203 mb-requirement-id-7206">
        (c) Decide how you can make the place safer and more comfortable for
        those using it. Redesign the area on another copy of the plan. You may
        want to include new walks, covered waiting areas, benches,
        space-defining plantings of trees and shrubs, and drainage structures.
