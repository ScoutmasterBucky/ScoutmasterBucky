      Cover the route of not less than 50 consecutive miles; take a minimum of
      five consecutive days to complete the trip without the aid of motors for
      the qualification of the 50-mile distance. For example, in the case of
      water treks and the use of motors, qualification distances exclude
      maneuvering in or out of slips or ports, safety/weather transverses,
      managing tidal currents, and accessing the open water. (In some areas
      pack animals may be used.) <b>Note:</b> Qualification for the 50-mile
      distance does not have to be continuous, provided the primary purpose
      objective is met.

      similar project may be done in the unitâ€™s home area. (There should be no
      unauthorized cutting of brush or timber.)
