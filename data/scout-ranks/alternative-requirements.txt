A Scout with a permanent physical or mental disability or a
disability expected to last more than two years or beyond the 18th
birthday and who is unable to complete all of the requirements for
Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, or First Class rank may, with his
or her parent or guardian, submit a request to the council
advancement committee to complete alternative requirements.
Below are the procedures for applying for alternative requirements.
To help facilitate this process, use the Individual Scout
Advancement Plan, No. 512-936, which can be found at www.
scouting.org/advancement. For more detailed information about
alternative requirements, see the Guide to Advancement.
1. Do as Many Existing Requirements as Possible. Before applying
for alternative requirements, as many of the existing requirements
must be completed as possible.
2. Prepare a Request for Alternative Requirements. Once the
Scout's best has been done to the limit of the Scout’s abilities
and resources, the unit leader or a troop committee member
submits to the council advancement committee a written request
for alternative requirements for Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class,
or First Class ranks. It must show what has been completed and
suggest the alternatives for those requirements the Scout
cannot do.
3. Secure a Medical Statement and Provide Supporting Documents.
The request must be accompanied by supporting letters from the
unit leader, a parent or guardian, and the Scout (if possible), as
well as a written statement from a qualified health professional
related to the nature of the disability. This may be, for example,
a physician, neurologist, psychiatrist, psychologist, etc., or, when
appropriate, an educational administrator in special education.
Statements must describe the disability; cover the Scout’s
capabilities, limitations, and prognosis; and outline what
requirements cannot be completed. Additional information such as
Individualized Education Plans (IEP) provided to parents by
schools, and various treatment summaries and reports, may help
an advancement committee make an informed decision.
4. The Advancement Committee Reviews the Request. The
advancement committee reviews the request, utilizing the expertise
of professionals involved with youth who have special needs. To
make a fair determination, the committee may want to interview
the Scout, the Scout's parents(s) or guardian(s), and the unit
leader. The committee's decision is then recorded and delivered
to the Scout and the unit leader.
