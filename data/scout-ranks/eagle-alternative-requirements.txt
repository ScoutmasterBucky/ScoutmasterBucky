EAGLE SCOUT RANK
Alternative Requirements
The Eagle Scout rank may be achieved by a Scout or a qualified14
Venturer or Sea Scout who has a physical or mental disability by
completing the Application for Alternative Eagle Scout Rank Merit
Badges, No. 512-730, and by qualifying for alternative merit badges.
This does not apply to individual requirements for merit badges.
Merit badges are awarded only when all requirements are met as
stated. See the Guide to Advancement, topic 10.2.2.3, for details.
The physical or mental disability must be of a permanent rather than
of a temporary nature or a disability expected to last more than two
years or beyond age 18. The application must include a written state-
ment from a qualified health professional related to the nature of
the disability. This person may be a physician, neurologist, psy-
chiatrist, psychologist, etc., or, when appropriate, an educational
administrator in special education.
Before applying, the Scout must earn as many of the Eagle-required
merit badges as possible. However, where a permanent disability
clearly precludes completing specific merit badges, a Scout who has
earned at least First Class may apply for an alternative merit badge
without waiting until all other Eagle-required merit badges are com-
plete. Any alternatives must present the same challenge and learn-
ing level as those they replace, and must be completed prior to the
18th birthday unless the member is registered beyond the age of eli-
gibility (reference Guide to Advancement, topic 10.1.0.1â€“10.1.0.2).
1. Obtain a clear and concise statement related to the nature of
the disability from a qualified health professional.
2. The unit leader meets with the candidate and the Scout's
parent or guardian to determine the alternative merit badges
to replace those impeding the Scout's advancement.
3. The unit leader, parent or guardian, and the Scout (if possible)
prepare supporting letters to accompany the application.
4. The district and council advancement committees, in turn,
review the proposed alternative merit badges. They may
choose to speak with the Scout, the Scout's parent or guardian,
or unit leader. If the council advancement committee approves,
then the candidate may start work on the approved alternative
merit badges.
Note: In approving the application, the district and council
advancement committees must utilize the expertise of a health-
care professional involved with youth who have disabilities.
14In order to be an Eagle Scout candidate, a Venturer or Sea Scout must have achieved First Class rank as a registered Scout
or as a Lone Scout.


5. Upon completion of the Eagle Scout rank requirements, using
the alternative merit badges, the candidate appears before a
board of review. The approved Application for Alternative
Eagle Scout Rank Merit Badges must be attached to the Eagle
Scout Rank Application.
6. Following a successful board of review, the council processes
both applications and forwards them to the National
Advancement Program Team. Local council action on alternative
merit badges does not require national approval.
