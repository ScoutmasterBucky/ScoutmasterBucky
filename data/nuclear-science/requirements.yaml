- requirement: 4
  text: |-
    Do TWO of the following; then discuss with your counselor:
  children:
    - requirement: a
      text: |-
        Build an electroscope. Show how it works. Place a radiation source
        inside and explain the effect it causes.
    - requirement: b
      text: |-
        Make a cloud chamber. Show how it can be used to see the tracks caused
        by radiation. Explain what is happening.

  text: |-
    Do ONE of the following; then discuss with your counselor the principles of
    radiation safety:
  children:
    - requirement: a
      text: |-
        Using a radiation survey meter and a radioactive source, show how the
        counts per minute change as the source gets closer to or farther from
        the radiation detector. Place three different materials between the
        source and the detector, then explain any differences in the
        measurements per minute. Explain how time, distance, and shielding can
        reduce an individual's radiation dose.
    - requirement: b
      text: |-
        Describe how radon is detected in homes. Discuss the steps taken for
        the long-term and short-term test methods, tell how to interpret the
        results, and explain when each type of test should be used. Explain the
        health concern related to radon gas and tell what steps can be taken to
        reduce radon in buildings.
    - requirement: c
      text: |-
        Visit a place where X-rays are used. Draw a floor plan of this room.
        Show where the unit, the unit operator, and the patient would be when
        the X-ray unit is operated. Explain the precautions taken and the
        importance of those precautions.
- requirement: 6
  text: |-

      text: |-
        Make a drawing showing how nuclear fission happens. Observe a mousetrap
        reactor (setup by an adult) and use it to explain how a chain reaction
        could be started. Explain how a chain reaction could be stopped or
        controlled in a nuclear reactor. Explain what is meant by a "critical
        mass."
