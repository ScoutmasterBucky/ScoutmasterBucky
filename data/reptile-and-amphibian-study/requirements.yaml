    NOTE: Scouts must not use venomous reptiles in fulfilling requirement 8a.
    When you decide keeping your specimen is no longer possible or desired, be
    sure to find another appropriate home for it or return it to the wild at
    the location of capture. Check with your counselor for those instances
    where the return of these specimens would not be appropriate. Under the
    Endangered Species Act of 1973, some plants and animals are, or may be,
    protected by federal law. The same ones and/or others may be protected by
    state law. Be sure that you do not collect protected species. Your state
    may require that you purchase and carry a license to collect certain
    species. Check with the wildlife and fish and game officials in your state
    regarding species regulations before you begin to collect.

        eats and what are its native habitat and home range, preferred climate,
        average life expectancy, and natural predators. Also identify any
        human-caused threats to its population and any laws that protect the

        have learned with your counselor.
