                  Discuss with your mentor the following situation:
                  Suppose you are writing a research paper and you find a
                  resource in which the author’s words are so perfectly
                  aligned with your perspectives and understanding that
                  you cannot imagine a better way to put it in your paper
                  than to use the author’s own words. How can you handle

      Review the scientific method (you may know this as the scientific
      process) and note how scientists establish hypotheses, theories, and
      laws. Compare how the establishment of “facts” or “rules” using the
      scientific method differs from the establishment of “facts” or “rules” in
      other environments, such as legal, cultural, religious, military,
      mathematical, or social environments. Then do each of the following:
