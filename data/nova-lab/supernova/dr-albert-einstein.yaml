      With guidance from your mentor, select a current STEM-related concern and
      develop a research project or experiment (“the project”) related to that
      area. Prepare a one-page written proposal detailing your scientific
      hypothesis or engineering objective and your proposed experimental
      methods, which must be approved by your council’s STEM Committee before
      you begin work. Execute the project or experiment, and then prepare a
      complete and well-documented written report AND an oral presentation.
      Present both the oral and written reports to your mentor and to your
      local council STEM committee.

            This research project or experiment should be challenging and

            If your mentor is not a specialist in the area of your project or
            experiment, they will request assistance from a specialist who will
            serve as a STEM consultant.
