Numbers Don’t Lie
This module is designed to help the Venturer or Sea Scout explore
how math affects his or her life each day.
1. Choose A or B or C or D and complete ALL the requirements.
A. Watch about three hours total of math-related shows or documentaries that involve
scientific models and modeling, physics, sports equipment design, bridge building, or
cryptography. Then do the following:
(1) Make a list of at least two questions or ideas from each show.
(2) Discuss two of the questions or ideas with your counselor.
Some examples include—but are not limited to—shows found on PBS (“NOVA”), Discovery
Channel, Science Channel, National Geographic Channel, and TED Talks (online videos). You
may choose to watch a live performance or movie at a science museum instead of watching a
media production. You may watch online productions with your counselor’s approval and
under your parent’s or guardian’s supervision.
B. Research (about three hours total) several websites (with your parent’s or guardian’s
permission) that discuss and explain cryptography or the discoveries of people who
worked extensively with cryptography. Then do the following:
(1) List and record the URLs of the websites you visited, and the major
topics covered on the websites you visited. (You may use the copy and
paste function—eliminate the words—if you include your sources.)
(2) Discuss with your counselor how cryptography is used in the military and in
everyday life and how a cryptographer uses mathematics.

A. Calculate your horsepower when you run up a flight of stairs.

“How to Calculate Your Horsepower”: wikiHow
http://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Your-Horsepower
1. Find out how much you weigh in kilograms and write it down. (Multiply your weight in pounds
by 0.454 to get kilograms.)
2. Find a stair, ladder, or something similar (as long as it gets you upward).
3. Measure the height (not the length) of the stairs (or whatever you use) from the bottom to the
ending point at the top and write it down. This can be done by multiplying the height of one
stair by the number of stairs (it doesn’t matter how long the stairs are.)
4. Take a running start toward the stairs. When you step on the first step, start the timer; when
both feet are on the top step, stop the timer. (You may skip stairs.) Now you have all the
numbers needed.
5. Calculate the Power (P) with this formula:


mah/t (m x 9.80 x h)/t, where
m = mass (your weight) in kilograms
a = acceleration (9.80 m/sec² is the acceleration caused by Earth’s gravity)
h = height of staircase in meters
t = time in seconds
6. The number you get is in watts, which is equal to joules per second (J/s) and newton meters per
second (Nm/s). If you don’t divide by time, you will calculate the energy needed to climb the
stairs.
Work = mah
Power = mah/t
Work (or energy) is measured in newton meters or joules; power is measured in joules/second
or watts.
7. Divide the number of watts by 745.6 w/hp to get the number in horsepower.
(1) How does your horsepower compare to the power of a horse?
Horsepower is a unit of power. One horsepower equals 33,000 foot-pounds of work per minute, or
745.6 watts. James Watt, who invented steam engines, based his unit of power on how much
weight a real horse could pull from a coal mine in one minute. (See “What Is Horsepower” at
www.web-cars.com/math/horsepower.html.)
(2) How does your horsepower compare to the horsepower of your favorite car?
Share your calculations with your counselor and discuss what you learned about horsepower. Most
car information packets and many websites list the horsepower of cars.
B. Attend at least two track, cross-country, or swim meets. You may substitute any sport
where there are timed events.
(1) For each meet, time at least three racers. (Time the same racers at each
meet.)
(2) Calculate the average speed of the racers you timed. (Make sure you write
down your data and calculations.)
(3) Compare the average speeds of your racers to each other, to the official time,
and to their times at the two meets you attended.
Share your calculations with your counselor, and discuss your conclusions about the racers’
strengths and weaknesses.
Average speed = Distance/Time


C. Attend a soccer, baseball, softball, or basketball game. Choose two players and keep
track of their efforts during the game. (Make sure you write down your data and
calculations.) Calculate their statistics using the following as examples:
(1) Soccer—Goals, assists, corner kicks, keeper saves, fouls, offsides
(2) Baseball or softball—Batting average, runs batted in, fielding statistics,
pitching statistics
(3) Basketball—Points, baskets attempted, rebounds, steals, turnovers, and
blocked shots
Share your calculations with your counselor, and discuss your conclusions about the players’
strengths and weaknesses.

(3) Defense—Number of quarterback sacks, interceptions turnovers, safeties


Share your calculations with your counselor, and discuss your conclusions about your team’s
strengths and weaknesses.
4. Do ALL of the following.
A. Investigate your calculator and explore the different functions.
B. Discuss the functions, abilities, and limitations of your calculator with your counselor.
Talk about how these affect what you can and cannot do with a calculator. (See your
counselor for some ideas to consider.)
5. Discuss with your counselor how math affects your everyday life.
Here are some ideas for your Scout to consider. Pick a few or think of others.
o How can you add fractions using your calculator and get an answer in fraction form?
o How can you perform repeated calculations efficiently?
o How many digits in a numerical answer can your calculator display? What if the answer
to your calculation has more digits than your calculator can display? Can you figure out
how many digits your answer has? Can you figure out the hidden digits?
o How can you enter, store, recall, and use a list of data to perform data analysis
calculations?
o For a calculator with graphing capabilities, how can you display a graph? Will a
graphing calculator always show the entire graph or does it sometimes show only a
portion of the graph? If it shows only a portion of the graph, how can you be certain
that the portion you are viewing shows the features you want to see?
o For numerical calculations, when does your calculator give exact answers and when
does it give approximate answers? What is the difference? How can you tell? Does it
matter?
o If your calculator defaults to giving you an approximate answer, but you need an exact
answer,
o what do you do?
o If an approximate answer will do, how might your calculator’s internal calculation
limitations
o affect the accuracy of the approximation?
o For a calculator with graphing capabilities, how might pixel limitations affect its
depiction of a
o graph?
o Is the calculator always right? Why or why not? How might you tell? What might
cause a calculator to give you an incorrect answer? (For a graphing calculator, what
might cause the calculator to give you an incorrect graph, no graph, or a graph that
cannot be readily interpreted?)


o Are there numerical calculations that calculators can’t do? If possible, give an example.
