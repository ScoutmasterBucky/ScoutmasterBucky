            Oil spills can be remediated in four ways: physically skimming the
            oil off the surface of the water, burning the oil, using
            surfactants to break the oil slick down, or doing nothing and
            letting nature take care of it.

            A surfactant is a material that lowers surface tension between two
            liquids, breaking down the barrier between them. They are used in
            detergents, dispersants, wetting agents, medicine, and so on.

            See

            Explainer: why are chemical dispersants used in oil spills?<br>

            https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11283/oil-spill-dispersants-efficacy-and-effects

            One activity could be having scouts try different tools to skim the
            oil using different tools – a paper towel, wood splint, steel wool,
            cotton balls, and so on. You could also have them build a physical
            oil skimmer. Which one collects the most oil and least water?

            Another activity could be putting oil and water into a sealed
            scintillation (or other clear) vial and shaking vigorously. What
            happens? Then add one drop of dishwashing liquid (Dawn works best)
            and shake again. What happens this time?

                        watershed covers, and other watersheds that are nearby.

                        **Watershed** - a geographic area that drains into a
                        common outflow point, which could be a river basin.

                        **Runoff** - That part of the precipitation, snow melt,
                        or irrigation water that appears in surface streams,
                        rivers, drains or sewers. It may be described by how
                        fast it appears, or by source.

                        **Runoff coefficient** - a dimensionless coefficient
                        that describes the amount of precipitation that runs
                        off an area, as opposed to being absorbed into the
                        ground. It ranges from 0 to 1, with larger values for
                        areas with pavement and steep gradients (roofs range
                        from 0.75 to 0.95), and lower for permeable,
                        well-vegetated areas such as forests and flat lands
                        (woodlands can range from 0.05 to 0.25). A composite
                        runoff coefficient is one that covers an area made up
                        of multiple types of surfaces – for example, a lot that
                        is ½ pavement and ½ asphalt would have a composite
                        coefficient that was proportional to the amount of each
                        surface area.

                        **Infiltration** – rainfall or other water that is
                        absorbed into the soil

                        **Point source pollution** - water pollution coming
                        from a single identifiable point, such as a
                        sewage-outflow pipe

                        **Non-point source pollution** – pollution collected as
                        water washes off a large area. Could include
                        pesticides, soil particles, and so on.

                        **Oceanic dead zones** – a low-oxygen area (hypoxic),
                        often found near the mouth of rivers, resulting from
                        "excessive nutrient pollution from human activities

                        will deposit:

                        the property is a grass lawn, the amount of runoff would
