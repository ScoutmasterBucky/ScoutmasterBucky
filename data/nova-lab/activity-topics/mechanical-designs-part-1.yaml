            Determine and gather the necessary tools. You are encouraged to
            find resources to help you with the deconstruction, such as written
            instructions or a repair specialist willing to volunteer his/her
            time. (The specialist cannot touch the object or the parts, or
            handle the tools during dismantling. You and any fellow youth must
            do all of the dismantling.)
