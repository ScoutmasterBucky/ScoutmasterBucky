      As a group, come to a consensus about the constraints and rules for your
      egg drop contest. Adopt, adapt, or make up your own rules. You might want
      to break into divisions, each with its own rules. (Youth with stronger
      STEM backgrounds should adopt more challenging constraints and rules.)
      Here are some guidelines. You must:

            Agree on constraints that the egg container must meet, such as

            Agree on rules to ensure fairness, such as judging decisions,
            conditions for elimination, scoring system, how to win, and so on.
            You may wish to have several different ways to win.
