            Using the data you have collected for part 1, determine how much
            variability you see from day to day. How much variability is there
            within a single 24-hour period? Is knowledge of one interval
            sufficient to predict the next eruption? Why or why not?

            Determine what patterns in the data are illuminated (or perhaps
            obscured) in the different graphical displays. Of the graphs you
            used, which one best illustrated the wait time pattern for Old
            Faithful? Would you refine your prediction strategy? If so, why and
            how? If not, why not?

            Use your prediction strategy to estimate all of the eruptions for
            the fourth 24-hour period, and compare your estimates to the actual
            eruption times. Calculate the differences between your estimates
            and the actual times. What is the maximum difference? Why are there
            patterns in the Old Faithful data? Is there a geological
            explanation?

            Create a report that describes and addresses your prediction
            strategy, includes your graphical displays, and explains how your
            graphical displays support your strategy.

            Discuss the data you have collected, your report, and what you have
            learned with your mentor.
