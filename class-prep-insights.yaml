    <p>While the counselor will facilitate aspects of this requirement during
    the class, the only way to guarantee the opportunity to complete this
    requirement is to come to the class prepared to share their conceptual
    ideas. It is recommended to prepare for requirement 6a as this is the
    component that the class will focus on.</p>
