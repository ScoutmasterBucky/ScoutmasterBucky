        Online Class Expectations

</div>

<p>
    Scoutmaster Bucky Online Class links will be sent out 12 to 24 hours prior
    to the class start time. Notification will be sent to the email address
    provided in the registration, so please make sure your email is correctly
    entered.
</p>

<p>
    Please be courteous and arrive 10-15 minutes prior to the scheduled class
    start time. Ensure that your internet connection, camera, microphone, and
    broadcasting environment are working and optimal for class participation.
    Remember that your Scout uniform is required to be worn when attending.
</p>

<p>
    It is <em>NOT</em> acceptable to come unprepared to a Scoutmaster Bucky
    event. You can (and should) use a
    <a href="/workbooks/">Scoutmaster Bucky Merit Badge Workbook</a> to help
    organize your preparation work. Please note that the use of any workbook is
    merely for note taking and reference. Completion of any merit badge workbook
    does not warrant, guarantee, or confirm a Scout's completion of any merit
    badge requirements. Merit badge counselors may refuse to accept workbooks,
    but they are <em>NEVER</em> allowed to require their use.
</p>

<p>
    The merit badge pamphlet has a wealth of information that provides valuable
    insight and clarification and can make earning any merit badge a lot easier.
    Doing preparation work and reviewing the merit badge pamphlet PRIOR to
    attending will ensure that Scouts get the most out of these class
    opportunities.
</p>

<p class="C(red) Fw(b)">
    Review and complete as many requirements as you are able before the class.
    Collect evidence of your actions (often photographs help) to help prove
    you've done work in advance. Pay careful attention to the action verbs
    within the requirements. An example to note:
</p>

<p class="C(red) Fw(b)">
    "Tell", "explain", "describe", and "discuss" are commonly used and will
    require the Scout to perform these actions during the class. When these
    action verbs are a part of any requirement, Scouts are expected to be
    prepared to share. Reading responses is not acceptable since it does not
    fulfill the requirement of showing the Scout's knowledge and understanding.
