Greetings, brave souls! The kingdom is in dire need of your assistance. Monstrous creatures have emerged from the surrounding forests, threatening the safety and prosperity of our people. We implore you, four valiant adventurers, to join forces and embark on a perilous journey to save our land.

Your efforts shall not go unrewarded. We shall grant you an audience with our gracious king and queen, who will bestow upon you riches and honors befitting your heroism.

Your adventure shall begin with a multitude of games and festivities. After partaking in a provided lunch, you will set off and the fate of our kingdom will rest in your hands. May the gods guide and protect you on your journey.
