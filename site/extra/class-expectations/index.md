summary: How to best prepare for a Scoutmaster Bucky class, online or in-person.
---

The Scoutmaster Bucky program strives to help teach responsibility to youth. The merit badges that are offered require the Scout to still complete all of the requirements to the counselor's satisfaction.

This guide helps cover frequently asked questions and common mistakes that Scouts make when they are first introduced to a Scoutmaster Bucky offering.

The majority of Scoutmaster Bucky's events and online sessions deal with [merit badges](/merit-badges/). Registration for one of these does not mean that a Scout will earn the award - the Scout needs to put in the effort to meet the wording of the requirements.

### Prerequisites and Preparation

It is expected that Scouts have read and understood the requirements for the [merit badge](/merit-badges/), [Nova award](../nova-lab/), or [other award](../other-awards/).

Read the merit badge pamphlet or do extra research online in order to fully understand the material.

When Scouts are not prepared, our high-quality counselors will attempt to still work with the youth to help achieve the merit badge. However, please understand that failure to prepare will almost certainly mean failure to earn the merit badge. When you pay to attend an event with a merit badge, you are not guaranteeing that your Scout will receive the merit badge.

### Workbooks

BSA discourages the use of merit badge workbooks and no counselor should view a completed workbook as having completed a merit badge. Any workbook is designed to be an organized place to take notes and to help recall information during discussions.

Scoutmaster Bucky workbooks are designed with extra space so a Scout can provide a richer answer and be more involved in the discussion. This helps ensure that the material was understood properly.

### The Day of the Event

What you should have:

* The merit badge pamphlet is strongly encouraged.
* Your notes or a completed merit badge workbook.
* Does your troop use Scoutbook? Bring your **BSA Member ID**.
* Does your troop use Blue Cards? Bring a blue card and understand the [blue card process](../blue-card-process/).
* A positive attitude, ready to participate in discussions.

# In Summary

Please come prepared. Earning merit badges is a journey of growth for a Scout and it is one place where responsibility is developed.
