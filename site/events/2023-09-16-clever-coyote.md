Can your team survive the Clever Coyote challenge? Participants will experience a simulated survival event where their wits and resourcefulness are put to the test. There is a new challenge each year.

*You're exploring a storage room at school filled with previous science fair experiments. The various dusty contraptions are fascinating! After going through a curious hatch, there seems to be some sort of bunker on the other side with lots of controls in front of a chair. Someone casually presses a blinking button and the hatch closes. The ship, you now realize, is taking you somewhere very strange.*

Open to adventurous youth involved with any Scouting program. Visit the [Clever Coyote website](https://clever-coyote.8b.io/) for more about this event plus a lot of great videos to help you prepare for the challenges ahead.
