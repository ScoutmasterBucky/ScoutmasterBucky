Gamehaven Council is offering a day-long opportunity to learn merit badge skills from experts in the Southeastern Minnesota area.

With this Pottery Merit Badge day, Scouts could complete all merit badge requirements, including firing a kiln, making pots, and more. Space is limited - only 15 Scouts may attend! A pizza lunch will be provided.
