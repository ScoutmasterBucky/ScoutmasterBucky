Can your team survive the Clever Coyote challenge? Participants will experience a simulated survival event where their wits and resourcefulness are put to the test. There is a new challenge each year.

*Your airplane is malfunctioning and is unable to stay aloft. The pilot calls for mayday and the worst imaginable scenario happens - the flight crashes. You survive with a couple others. You're in unfamiliar territory and you've still got a job to do.*

Open to adventurous youth involved with any Scouting program. Visit the [Clever Coyote website](https://clever-coyote.8b.io/) for more about this event plus a lot of great videos to help you prepare for the challenges ahead.
