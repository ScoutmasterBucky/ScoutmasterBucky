Wood Badge is a world-class leadership development program intended for all Scout leaders. Reflecting the best of nearly a century of Scouting experience, Wood Badge draws upon the most current leadership models used by corporate America, academic circles and successful organizations throughout the country.

Wood Badge training was begun by Baden Powell in 1919 as a way to insure that the leaders of Scout troops were properly trained. Since then Wood Badge has been held worldwide, providing advanced leadership training to thousands of Scout leaders.

Wood Badge builds upon the best traditions and experiences of the Boy Scouts of America and also draws from a wide range of courses within and beyond the bounds of Scouting to present the latest in leadership theory and team development.

By taking Wood Badge, Scouters will acquire valuable tools such as listening, communicating, conflict management, project planning and leading change. Participants will better learn to understand and appreciate diversity and differences in our society. They will learn skills that will make them a better Scout leader. Units with trained leaders are able to deliver an improved program and a more meaningful experience for the youth Scouting serves.

By attending Wood Badge, the participants will internalize the 5 themes of Wood Badge: Living the Values, Growing, Connecting, Guiding, Empowering. Apply the skills learned from your participation as a member of a successful working team to your Scouting position as well as your professional life. Revitalize your commitment to youth by sharing in an overall inspirational experience that helps provide Scouting with the leadership it needs to accomplish its mission on an ongoing basis

Journey to Excellence requirements emphasize the need to have at least one unit leader Wood Badge trained.  This is your opportunity to become Wood Badge trained.
