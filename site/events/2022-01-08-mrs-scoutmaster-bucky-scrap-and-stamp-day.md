Hey Scouting Adults, Parents, and Friends and Family while your Scouts work on Merit Badges all day, why don't you settle in with Mrs. Scoutmaster Bucky and Friends for the day to Scrapbook, Stamp, and Make Cards.

Representatives from the industry will be present and share their product lines and provide demonstrations. Most importantly, you can meet others who enjoy the passion you have for scrapping and/or card making.  Share ideas, share patterns, share extra materials, trade ideas and materials, a full day of fun.  

Partake in the Scrapping Swap where you bring your old no longer needed materials and trade or swap with others.  Mrs Scoutmaster Bucky and others are bringing their tools (cricket machines, hand punches, etc) to share for you to use as well. You don't want to miss out on this. Registration includes door prizes - Space is limited to 15 participants.

*Bring your own lunch or grab something at one of the many nearby restaurants*
