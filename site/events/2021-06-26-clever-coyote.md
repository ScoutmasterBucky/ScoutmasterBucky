**This is the same challenge as what the youth faced, but teams are comprised of adults. In a fair reversal of roles, youth are allowed to be staff members and they get to judge the adults.**

Participants test their bushcraft skills is in order to survive the night. Teams of 3 to 5 will have their wilderness survival knowledge and techniques under scrutiny to see if your group really could accomplish the goals. The team earns points, rewards, and food by completing challenges. Preparation will be vital, but luckily the website has numerous videos to assist you.
