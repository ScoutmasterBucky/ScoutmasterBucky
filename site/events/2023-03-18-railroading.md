This merit badge class will focus on the model railroading components of the Railroading Merit Badge.  The class will take place at the North Metro Model Railroad Club facility in Coon Rapids (1929 Coon Rapids Boulevard to be exact). Entrance is on back side of building on the North East Corner next to the VFW.

This merit badge session will be a learn and earn session where Scouts will work in the three hour time slot to complete the merit badge.  However, in order to complete the merit badge in the time allotted a Scout must be prepared.  Requirements 2a and 8a1 will NOT be covered in the class, however in order to be considered for completion of the badge during the class Scouts must have these completed prior to the class and bring with them for review by the Counselor.

Scouts are still required to review the merit badge pamphlet in preparation for discussion on the other requirements during the class. Having these things ready and completed prior to class will offer the greatest probability of completing this merit badge that day.  NOTE: you will not be able to complete the merit badge that day if you do not prepare.

All proceeds will be given to NMMRC to further their community outreach.
