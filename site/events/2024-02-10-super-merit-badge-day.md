Bring $15 cash or check, payable to "Troop 5" to cover the cost of the event. If not staying for lunch or bringing your own, bring only $10. Use the registration link to register for sessions.

For the list of classes and their prerequisites, check [this page](https://easternwaters.org/super-merit-badge-day-mb-list-and-prerequisites/). Please come prepared, otherwise only partial credit will be awarded for the merit badge and you will have follow up work to complete.

Workbooks are strongly encouraged. Bring your notes to aid in the group discussions. Also remember to bring proof of any work that needs to be done in advance and be ready to demonstrate completion to your counselor. Don't forget your blue card!
