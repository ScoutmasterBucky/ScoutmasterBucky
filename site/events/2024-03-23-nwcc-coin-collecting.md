This is a fantastic one-day event where Scouts can earn their Coin Collecting merit badge, and it happens during a coin show.

**Come prepared!** You must complete requirements 6 through 9 and offer hints to help you. Also, review the other requirements and be prepared to engage in discussion. The [Scoutmaster Bucky Coin Collecting Workbook](/merit-badges/coin-collecting/workbook/) would be helpful for you to organize your notes.

If you need coins to help complete your collections, there will be some time during the session to visit the show. Please bring money if you need to purchase items.

Registration is done through email. The cost is $5, payable via a check mailed to the organizer.
