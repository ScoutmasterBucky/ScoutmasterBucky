Ten Ring is offering 10 classes to help Scouts earn the Rifle Shooting merit badge over the course of two days. Your selected class is expected to run for approximately three hours.

If you are seeking this merit badge, then this opportunity is the one you really want to do. They have an extremely organized, patient, and friendly approach. Classes are small, with six Scouts. The event fills extremely fast, so register early.

Female Scouts will require a female leader or parent to accompany them.

The organization asks for a $10 donation to cover the costs. Also, Scouts are asked to remember to "do a good turn daily" and bring a non-perishable food donation that would be supplied to the local food shelf.
