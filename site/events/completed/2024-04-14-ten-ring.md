Ten Ring is offering several sessions on April 13th and 14th to allow your Scout to earn the Rifle Shooting merit badge. Registration is required, no walk-ins.

Come to the class with a current Rifle Shooting merit badge pamphlet, a signed merit badge blue card, and a signed [permission slip](https://www.tenring.org/_docs/NSCShootingPermissionSlip.pdf).

The organization asks for a $10 donation to cover the costs. Also, Scouts are asked to remember to "do a good turn daily" and bring a non-perishable food donation that would be supplied to the local food shelf.
