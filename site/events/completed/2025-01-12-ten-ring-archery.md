Ten Ring is offering the Archery merit badge at a warm, indoor archery range. They will cover all of the requirements. They also provide the range time, all equipment, and snacks. The Scout is expected to finish the "bookwork" portion before coming to class.

Female Scouts will require a female leader or parent to accompany them.

The organization asks for a $5 donation to cover the costs. Also, Scouts are asked to remember to "do a good turn daily" and bring a non-perishable food donation that would be supplied to the local food shelf.
