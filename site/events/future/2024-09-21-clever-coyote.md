Can your team survive the Clever Coyote challenge? Participants will experience a simulated survival event where their wits and resourcefulness are put to the test. There is a new challenge each year.

*The company's reply showed up in the mail and everyone on your team is there to get the news at the same time. Finally, it is ripped open and the letter read aloud. "We are excited by your idea and believe it has merit. Please use the enclosed equipment and let us see what you can do."*

Open to adventurous youth involved with any Scouting program. Visit the [Clever Coyote website](https://clever-coyote.8b.io/) for more about this event plus a lot of great videos to help you prepare for the challenges ahead.
