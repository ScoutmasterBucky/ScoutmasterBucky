    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts will need to be prepared with an understanding and skills to demonstrate all components of this requirement during the class.

The counselor / instructor will facilitate time during the class for each Scout to demonstrate their knowledge and ability on each of these components for Requirement 1.{{/note}}
2. Complete an electrical home safety inspection of your home, using the checklist found in the *Electricity* merit badge pamphlet or one approved by your counselor. Discuss what you find with your counselor.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}This requirement will not be able to be completed during the class without some preparation work at home prior to the class.  As the requirement states, you must use the home safety inspection checklist found in the Electricity Merit Badge pamphlet to work on this requirement.  It is requested that an adult family member initials or signs the checklist to validate the completion of this prior to the class.  Only Scouts having prepared for this requirement by doing the home safety inspection to the satisfaction of the counselor / instructor, will be considered for sign off on this requirement during the class. Class time will be allotted for discussion on this requirement for all who have come prepared.{{/note}}
3. Make a simple electromagnet and use it to show magnetic attraction and repulsion.
    {{#note type="inPerson"}}It is encouraged that Scouts review this requirement and attempt to make an electromagnet prior to the class.  The class will have this requirement as an activity which will allow all Scouts an opportunity to help build an electromagnet, however, if the class time is running short, this requirement will be the one that is cut and only Scouts who have done preparation work and can show their home-made electromagnet will be considered for sign off.{{/note}}
    {{#note type="online"}}Scouts will need to attend the class with their electromagnet already constructed.  Directions on how to put one together can be found in the Electricity Merit Badge pamphlet and/or through a simple internet query.  Only Scouts that successfully create an electromagnet AND share it during the class will be considered for sign off on this requirement.  Scouts alternatively may make arrangemenets with the merit badge counselor for review and completion of this after the class.{{/note}}
4. Explain the difference between direct current and alternating current.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should review the merit badge pamphlet for an explanation and understanding of this requirement.  Each Scout will have an opportunity to explain their findings with the counselor / instructor.{{/note}}
5. Make a simple drawing to show how a battery and an electric bell work.
    {{#note type="inPerson"}}This requirement will be covered during the class however Scouts should consider reviewing the merit badge pamphlet on this subject so they have a general understanding of the requirement.{{/note}}
    {{#note type="online"}}This requirement will be reviewed during the class, however Scouts will need to make their diagram ahead of the class to be prepared for this requirement during the class.{{/note}}
6. Explain why a fuse blows or a circuit breaker trips. Tell how to find a blown fuse or tripped circuit breaker in your home. Show how to safely reset the circuit breaker.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}While this requirement will be covered in the class, Scouts should review their merit badge pamphlet so they are prepared to explain their understanding of the requirement.{{/note}}
7. Explain what overloading an electric circuit means. Tell what you have done to make sure your home circuits are not overloaded.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Again, this is another requirement that will be covered in the class however Scouts should review the merit badge pamphlet for a better understanding of the requirement and be prepared to give explanation of their understanding.{{/note}}
8. Make a floor plan wiring diagram of the lights, switches, and outlets for a room in your home. Show which fuse or circuit breaker protects each one.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should do this requirement prior to the class.  Even if it is simply identifying where outlets and lights are located, the counselor / instructor will help refine these drawings with actual electrical schematics.{{/note}}
9. Do the following:
    (a) Read an electric meter and, using your family's electric bill, determine the energy cost from the meter readings.
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts will want to review with their parent(s) prior to the class this requirement and come prepared to the class to share their findings.  It is strongly recommended that any supporting documentation or pictures Scouts can bring with will help the counselor / instructor better assess their completion of this requirement.{{/note}}
    (b) Discuss with your counselor five ways in which your family can conserve energy.
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}This component of the requirement will be completed in the class however, Scouts should come prepared with ideas that they can share during the class discussion as it pertains to this component of the requirement.{{/note}}
10. Explain the following electrical terms: volt, ampere, watt, ohm, resistance, potential difference, rectifier, rheostat, conductor, ground, GFCI, circuit, and short circuit.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts can easily define these terms through the review of the Electricity Merit Badge pamphlet.  It is recommended that Scouts utilize a Merit Badge Workbook or a notebook to make notes on their findings.  These notes can be used to help with their explanation of each of the terms during the class.  It should be noted that Scouts simply reading the answers or recycling the words from the merit badge pamphlet for these terms will NOT be signed off on this requirement.  Scouts should clearly understand the terms and not just read their answers.{{/note}}
11. Do any TWO of the following:
    (a) Connect a buzzer, bell, or light with a battery. Have a key or switch in the line.
    (b) Make and run a simple electric motor (not from a kit).
    (c) Build a simple rheostat. Show that it works.
    (d) Build a single-pole, double-throw switch. Show that it works.
    (e) Hook a model electric train layout to a house circuit. Tell how it works.
    {{#note type="inPerson"}}Scouts are encouraged to consider doing this requirement ahead of time, but it is not necessary as the counselor will have projects set up during the class for Scouts to explore and discover as they complete this requirement.{{/note}}
    {{#note type="online"}}Scouts will need to choose two of the requirement components and bring their prepared work to the class for review and discussion with the counselor / instructor during the class.{{/note}}
