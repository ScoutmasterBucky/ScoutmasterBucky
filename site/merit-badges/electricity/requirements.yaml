            utilize a Merit Badge Workbook or a notebook to make notes on their
            findings.  These notes can be used to help with their explanation
            of each of the terms during the class.  It should be noted that
            Scouts simply reading the answers or recycling the words from the
            merit badge pamphlet for these terms will NOT be signed off on this
