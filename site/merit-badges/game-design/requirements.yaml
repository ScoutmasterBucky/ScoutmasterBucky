            Scout should come prepared to the class ready to share their
            analysis of the games they have played.  When preparing for this
            requirement, Scouts may find it helpful to have notes organized and
            ready for sharing during the class as it may be difficult to record
            this information during the class and thus fall behind the
            discussion trying to keep up with taking notes.

            Requirements 4, 5, 6 and 7 will be covered and managed by the
            counselor in the class. Scouts still need to have read the merit
            badge pamphlet prior to the class in order to complete these
            requirements.  These 4 requirements will be worked on for the
            majority of the class.  Scouts are expected to be attentive and
            courteous during this class in order to potentially finish all the
            components in these requirements.  While the intention, and plan,
            is to offer Scouts the ability to finish all of these requirement
            in the class, performance and behavior may affect individual, small
            group of, or the entire class of Scouts in fulfilling all of these
            requirements.
