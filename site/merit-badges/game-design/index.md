    (a) Analyze four games you have played, each from a different medium. Identify the medium, player format, objectives, rules, resources, and theme (if relevant). Discuss with your counselor the play experience, what you enjoy in each game, and what you dislike. Make a chart to compare and contrast the games.
    (b) Describe four types of play value and provide an example of a game built around each concept. Discuss with your counselor other reasons people play games.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scout should come prepared to the class ready to share their analysis of the games they have played.  When preparing for this requirement, Scouts may find it helpful to have notes organized and ready for sharing during the class as it may be difficult to record this information during the class and thus fall behind the discussion trying to keep up with taking notes.{{/note}}

    **Thematic game elements:** story, setting, characters
    **Gameplay elements:** play sequence, level design, interface design
    **Game analysis:** difficulty, balance, depth, pace, replay value, age appropriateness
    **Related terms:** single-player vs. multiplayer, cooperative vs. competitive, turn-based vs. real-time, strategy vs. reflex vs. chance, abstract vs. thematic
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}The answers for this requirement can be easily found in the merit badge pamphlet and Scouts should be prepared for discussion on each of the components of this requirement in the class.  Some Scouts may find it helpful to utilize a Merit Badge Workbook to organize their notes and findings for easier reference during the class and to better ensure completion of this requirement in the class.{{/note}}
3. Define the term intellectual property. Describe the types of intellectual property associated with the game design industry. Describe how intellectual property is protected and why protection is necessary. Define and give an example of a licensed property.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should review this requirement and its terms and be prepared to explain.  It is strongly recommended that Scouts bring any notes or supporting documents they may have to help show the counselor that they have prepared for explanation of these items. The intellectual property term, types, and process will be discussed in the class.{{/note}}
4. Do the following:
    (a) Pick a game where the players can change the rules or objectives (examples: basketball, hearts, chess, kickball). Briefly summarize the standard rules and objectives and play through the game normally.
    (b) Propose changes to several rules or objectives. Predict how each change will affect gameplay.
    (c) Play the game with one rule or objective change, observing how the players’ actions and emotional experiences are affected by the rule change. Repeat this process with two other changes.
    (d) Explain to your counselor how the changes affected the actions and experience of the players. Discuss the accuracy of your predictions.

    (c) Share your game design notebook with your counselor. Discuss the player reactions to your project and what you learned about the game design process. Based on your testing, determine what you like most about your game and suggest one or more changes.

Scouts still need to have read the merit badge pamphlet prior to the class in order to complete these requirements.  These 4 requirements will be worked on for the majority of the class.  Scouts are expected to be attentive and courteous during this class in order to potentially finish all the components in these requirements.  While the intention, and plan, is to offer Scouts the ability to finish all of these requirement in the class, performance and behavior may affect individual, small group of, or the entire class of Scouts in fulfilling all of these requirements.{{/note}}
