{{#requirements}}
1. Earn the First Aid merit badge.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should bring proof of their completion of the First Aid Merit Badge to class. Simply saying that you have completed it will NOT be enough for the counselor to sign off on this requirement.  While it is preferred that Scouts have their First Aid Merit Badge prior to working on this merit badge, the requirement does not require that the First Aid Merit Badge be earned in order to work on the other requirements.  Scouts attending that do not have their First Aid Merit Badge will need to earn their First Aid Merit Badge before they will be able to complete this requirement for the Emergency Preparedness Merit Badge.{{/note}}
2. Do the following:
    (a) Discuss with your counselor the aspects of emergency preparedness:
        (1) Prevention
        (2) Protection
        (3) Mitigation
        (4) Response
        (5) Recovery
        Include in your discussion the kinds of questions that are important to ask yourself as you consider each of these.
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts must review the merit badge pamphlet to gain an initial understanding of the concepts for this requirement.  Scouts will discuss in a group with the counselor their findings and should come prepared with questions that might be important to ask in the consideration of each of these components of the requirement.  It is recommended that Scouts utilize a Merit Badge Workbook to write down and formulate their thoughts and questions as it pertains to this requirement prior to the class so that they are prepared for discussion during the class.  It will be difficult, if not impossible for Scouts who do not prepare for this requirement to complete the requirement without active participation in the group discussion at the class.{{/note}}
    (b) Using a chart, graph, spreadsheet, or another method approved by your counselor, demonstrate your understanding of each aspect of emergency preparedness listed in requirement 2a (prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery) for 10 emergency situations from the list below. **You must use the first five situations listed below in boldface,** plus any other five of your choice. Discuss your findings with your counselor.
        **(1)** **Home kitchen fire**
        **(2)** **Home basement/storage room/garage fire**
        **(3)** **Explosion in the home**
        **(4)** **Automobile crash**
        **(5)** **Food-borne disease (food poisoning)**
        (6) Fire or explosion in a public place
        (7) Vehicle stalled in the desert
        (8) Vehicle trapped in a blizzard

        (13) Tornado or hurricane
        (14) Major flooding or a flash flood
        (15) Toxic chemical spills and releases
        (16) Nuclear power plant emergency
        (17) Avalanche (snowslide or rockslide)
        (18) Violence in a public place
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}While this requirement component will be covered in the class, it does need to have some preparation done ahead of time. The majority of time during the class will be spent discussing Scouts' findings and thoughts in addressing these scenarios.  Drawing out one's chart ahead of time will ensure the highest probability of completing this requirement component in the class.  Scouts who do not come with a chart and at least the required five scenarios prepared ahead of time will likely not have an opportunity of completing this requirement component.{{/note}}
    (c) Meet with and teach your family how to get or build a kit, make a plan, and be informed for the situations on the chart you created for requirement 2b. Complete a family plan. Then meet with your counselor and report on your family meeting, discuss their responses, and share your family plan.
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}A note from a parent or guardian living with you stating the scenarios from 2b discussed at home will help ensure completion of this requirement component. Scouts should bring their kit (or a photo will suffice) along with an outline of their plan (shown or included on your chart from requirement 2b) to share with the counselor and the class. Scouts that are unable to provide clear proof of this family activity will find it difficult, if not impossible, to complete this requirement component as a part of the class.{{/note}}
3. Show how you could safely save a person from the following:
    (a) Touching a live household electric wire
    (b) A structure filled with carbon monoxide
    (c) Clothes on fire
    (d) Drowning using nonswimming rescues (including accidents on ice)
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}This requirement will be discussed in class however, Scouts should review these sections in the merit badge pamphlet prior to the class to have a basic understanding of methods to utilize for each scenario. Scouts should be prepared for discussion and demonstration of their findings. Scouts who do not come having done this preapration work will find it difficult, if not impossible, to complete this requirement and it's components as a part of the class.{{/note}}
4. Show three ways of attracting and communicating with rescue planes/aircraft.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts will discuss this requirement in class.  The Merit Badge Pamphlet has a section on this subject that should be referenced and reviewed as a preparation exercise for this requirement.  Scouts may find it helpful to make notes in their Merit Badge Workbook for easy reference during the class to aid them in showing and sharing their findings.{{/note}}
5. With another person, show a good way to transport an injured person out of a remote and/or rugged area, conserving the energy of rescuers while ensuring the well-being and protection of the injured person.
    {{#note type="inPerson"}}Scouts will learn, practice, and demonstrate their knowledge and skill for this requirement during the class.{{/note}}
    {{#note type="online"}}Scouts will need to work with another person prior to the class and come up with a way to share their ability to show this skill to the counselor.  This may include, having another person and equipment ready during the class to demonstrate, videoing the moment, etc.{{/note}}
6. Do the following:
    (a) Describe the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident and the Incident Command System (ICS).
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}While this requirement will be covered in the class through group discussion, Scouts should still familiarize themselves with these items and be prepared to share their understanding during the class.  Only Scouts that are able to show that they have prepared for this requirement ahead of time will be signed off on this requirement component.  It is NOT acceptable to come to the class and expect to be "fed" this information during the class and still receive credit.{{/note}}
    (b) Identify the government or community agencies that normally handle and prepare for emergency services similar to those of the NIMS or ICS. Explain to your counselor ONE of the following:
        (1) How the NIMS/ICS can assist a Scout troop when responding in a disaster
        (2) How a group of Scouts could volunteer to help in an even of these types of emergencies
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts will need to have researched and prepared ahead of time for this requirement to be completed during the class. This requirement will be discussed in the class, however only Scouts that have done their preparation on this will have the opportunity to be considered for sign off on this requirement. Unprepared Scouts will not necessarily be signed off just for listening to the counselor and others share their information. Scouts should organize their thoughts and findings in a way that they can easily share what they found for this requirement during the class.{{/note}}
    (c) Find out who is your community's emergency management director and learn what this person does to **prevent, protect, mitigate, respond to, and recover from** emergency situations in your community. Discuss this information with your counselor, utilizing the information you learned from requirement 2b.
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}To complete this requirement, Scouts will need to share with the counselor the person or agency responsible for emergency preparedness in their community.  In some cases, this may be a multitude of people or organizations depending on the scenario. Scouts should come prepared with this information in order to complete this requirement at the class.{{/note}}
7. Do the following:
    (a) Take part in an emergency service project, either a real one or a practice drill, with a Scouting unit or a community agency.
        {{#note type="inPerson"}}This requirement will be completed in the class however it must be noted that Scouts will be going outside to perform this requirement.  PLEASE BRING/WEAR WEATHER APPROPRIATE ATTIRE FOR THE DAY.  Scouts not found to have the proper outdoor attire for the day's weather conditions will not be allowed for safety reasons to participate and hence will not have an opportunity to complete this requirement.{{/note}}
        {{#note type="online"}}This requirement will NOT be completed in the class, however Scouts that can bring satisfactory proof of having already completed this requirement should bring proof for review by the merit badge counselor. If the counselor is satisfied with the discussion and "proof" submitted, Scouts will have an opportunity to be signed off on this requirement component as a part of the class.{{/note}}
    (b) Prepare a written plan for mobilizing your troop when needed to do emergency service. If there is already a plan, explain it. Tell your part in making it work.
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts whose troop already has a written plan to do emergency service should bring a copy of that or notes that cover the plan for sharing during the class.  Scouts should be prepared to share their responsibility in the plan when executed. If your Troop does not have a plan, time will be given in the class in order for you to create one. Scouts will need to be aware that this written plan will need to be completed before the end of the class in order to receive credit of completion for this requirement. A written plan does not necessarily need to be hand-written, so Scouts with writing challenges may want to consider bringing a laptop or tablet to class for use to complete this requirement.{{/note}}
8. Do the following:
    (a) Tell the things a group of Scouts should be prepared to do, the training they need, and the safety precautions they should take for the following emergency services:
        (1) Crowd and traffic control
        (2) Messenger service and communications
        (3) Collection and distribution services
        (4) Group feeding, shelter, and sanitation
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}While this requirement will be covered in the class through group discussion, Scouts should still familiarize themselves with methods and practices for each of these scenarios.  It may be helpful to us a Merit Badge Workbook to make notes ahead of time for easier reference and sharing during the class group discussion for each of the scenarios.  This type of preparation helps the counselor identify Scouts more easily that prepared and have thought out their response to this requirement.  Only Scouts that actively participate in the discussion during the class will have the opportunity of completing this requirement.{{/note}}
    (b) Prepare a personal emergency service pack for a mobilization call. Prepare a family emergency kit (suitcase or waterproof box) for use by your family in case an emergency evacuation is needed. Explain the needs and uses of the contents.
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts whose troop already has a written plan to do emergency service should bring a copy or notes that cover the plan for sharing during the class.  Scouts should be prepared to share their responsibility in the plan when executed. If your Troop does not have a plan, time will be given in the class in order for you to create one. Scouts will need to be aware that this written plan will need to be completed before the end of the class in order to receive credit of completion for this requirement. A written plan does not necessarily need to be hand-written, so Scouts with writing challenges may want to consider bringing a laptop or tablet to class for use to complete this requirement.{{/note}}
9. Do ONE of the following:
    (a) Using a safety checklist approved by your counselor, inspect your home for potential hazards. Explain the hazards you find and how they can be corrected.
    (b) Review or develop a plan of escape for your family in case of fire in your home.
    (c) Develop an accident prevention program for five family activities outside the home (such as taking a picnic or seeing a movie) that includes an analysis of possible hazards, a proposed plan to correct those hazards, and the reasons for the corrections you propose.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}In order to complete this requirement Scouts will need to bring documentation of one of these components to share in the class.  It is highly recommended that a note signed by a parent or guardian with whom you live with stating your review and completion of one of these components with your family would serve to help the counselor validate your completion. Please note that simply having a signed note is not enough for completion of this requirement.  In each component of the requirement it requires some sort of additional documentation, chart, plan, etc to be included as a part of fulfilling this requirement.  Scouts should bring both their work and signed note to class.{{/note}}
