            Scouts should bring proof of their completion of the First Aid
            Merit Badge to class. Simply saying that you have completed it will
            NOT be enough for the counselor to sign off on this requirement.
            While it is preferred that Scouts have their First Aid Merit Badge
            prior to working on this merit badge, the requirement does not
            require that the First Aid Merit Badge be earned in order to work
            on the other requirements.  Scouts attending that do not have their
            First Aid Merit Badge will need to earn their First Aid Merit Badge
            before they will be able to complete this requirement for the
            Emergency Preparedness Merit Badge.

                  Scouts must review the merit badge pamphlet to gain an
                  initial understanding of the concepts for this requirement.
                  Scouts will discuss in a group with the counselor their
                  findings and should come prepared with questions that might
                  be important to ask in the consideration of each of these
                  components of the requirement.  It is recommended that Scouts
                  utilize a Merit Badge Workbook to write down and formulate
                  their thoughts and questions as it pertains to this
                  requirement prior to the class so that they are prepared for
                  discussion during the class.  It will be difficult, if not
                  impossible for Scouts who do not prepare for this requirement
                  to complete the requirement without active participation in
                  the group discussion at the class.

            In order to complete this requirement Scouts will need to bring
            documentation of one of these components to share in the class.  It
            is highly recommended that a note signed by a parent or guardian
            with whom you live with stating your review and completion of one
            of these components with your family would serve to help the
            counselor validate your completion. Please note that simply having
            a signed note is not enough for completion of this requirement.  In
            each component of the requirement it requires some sort of
            additional documentation, chart, plan, etc to be included as a part
            of fulfilling this requirement.  Scouts should bring both their
            work and signed note to class.
