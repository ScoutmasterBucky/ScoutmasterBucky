    (a) Define and discuss with your counselor the following disabilities awareness terms: disability, accessibility, adaptation, accommodation, invisible disability, person-first language, and inclusion.
    (b) Explain why proper disability etiquette is important, and how it may differ depending on the specific disability. Give three examples.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should review this requirement and its components and be prepared to discuss and explain their findings during the class.  Only Scouts who actively and positively participate in the class discussion showing they have prepared for this requirement will be considered for sign off on this requirement.{{/note}}
2. Visit an agency that works with people with physical, mental, emotional, or educational disabilities. Collect and read information about the agency's activities. Learn about opportunities its members have for training, employment, and education. Discuss what you have learned with your counselor.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}This requirement will NOT be covered as a part of this class.  Scouts must complete this requirement either before or after the day of the class, HOWEVER Scouts who can show documented proof of completing this requirement will have the opportunity to share with the counselor / instructor their accomplishment(s) and potentially be signed off on this requirement.  It is STRONGLY recommended Scouts interested in completing this merit badge bring their work for requirement 2 when attending the class.  If the work meets the satisfaction of the merit badge counselor, (saying you did it is not enough, you need to bring proof), most counselors will likely sign off on the requirement after a short discussion.{{/note}}
3. Do TWO of the following:
    (a) Talk with a Scout who has a disability and learn about the Scout's experiences taking part in Scouting activities and earning different merit badges. Discuss what you have learned with your counselor.
    (b) Talk to an individual who has a disability and learn about this person's experiences and the activities in which this person likes to participate. Discuss what you have learned with your counselor.
    (c) Learn how people with disabilities take part in a particular adaptive sport or recreational activity. Discuss what you have learned with your counselor.
    (d) Learn about independent living aids such as service animals, canes, and augmentative communication devices such as captioned telephones and videophones. Discuss with your counselor how people use such aids.
    (e) Plan or participate in an activity that helps others understand what a person with a visible or invisible disability experiences. Discuss what you have learned with your counselor.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts will complete most, if not all, of this requirement in class.  Reading of the merit badge pamphlet ahead of time will provide Scouts with the preparation they will need for this requirement prior to the class.  Scouts are still encouraged to choose two of these components from Requirement 3 to research prior to the class to bring further knowledge and understanding to the discussion during the class.  Scouts will need to partake in the discussion with some knowledge on these components for consideration by the counselor for sign off.  Just attending and listening to what the counselor lectures about is not enough for sign off, Scouts are to share their knowledge as the requirement states.  The counselor / instructor will likely cover all four components to ensure all Scouts have an opportunity to share in at least two of these requirement components.{{/note}}
4. Do EITHER option A or option B:
    **Option A.** Visit TWO of the following locations and take notes about the accessibility to people with disabilities. In your notes, give examples of five things that could be done to improve upon the site and five things about the site that make it friendly to people with disabilities.

    (a) Your school
    (b) Your place of worship

    (d) A public exhibit or attraction (such as a theater, museum, or park)

    (a) Your school
    (b) Your place of worship

    (d) A public exhibit or attraction (such as a theater, museum, or park)
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should review this requirement and its components and be prepared to discuss.  It is strongly recommended that Scouts bring any notes or supporting documents they may have to help show the counselor that they have prepared for discussion on each of the components for either one of the options.{{/note}}

    (a) Present a counselor-approved disabilities awareness program to a Cub Scout pack or other group. During your presentation, explain and use person first language.

    (c) Using resources such as disability advocacy agencies, government agencies, the Internet (with your parent's permission), and news magazines, learn about myths and misconceptions that influence the general public's understanding of people with disabilities. List 10 myths and misconceptions about people with disabilities and learn the facts about each myth. Share your list with your counselor, then use it to make a presentation to a Cub Scout pack or other group.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts will have an opportunity to share their presentation during the class as well as provide supporting proof of their work on one of the components of this Requirement.
