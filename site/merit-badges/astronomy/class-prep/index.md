        <p><span class="C(red)">These requirement components will be miopssible to complete during the class. Scouts should come to class with notes, drawings, sketches, or other documentation showing that they have observed the night skies and identified 10 constellations along with at least 8 stars of which 5 are of magnitude 1 or brighter (check you Merit Badge Pamphlet for explanation and guidance). The easiest way to do this is to record the date and time of the observation and describe the location of the constellation or star as it appears in the sky.</span></p>
        <p>NOTE: Stars and Constellations move about the sky depending on time of year and time of night they are observed, so the tracking of date and time of the observation is crucial. Many online resources are available to aid in the identification of these stars and constellations throughout the year. Drawing the constellation as it appears during your observation in the sky may be helpful as well. It must also be noted that just saying you have done these two components of requirement 4 will NOT be enough to be signed off during the class. You must provide some sort of supporting documentation to the counselor to show that you have worked on and met the expectations of these components; Requirement 4a and 4b.</p>
