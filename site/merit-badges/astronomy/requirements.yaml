            It should go without saying that Scouts should review the
            merit badge pamphlet for this requirement as all the required
            knowledge and recommendations will be found within the
            contents of the Merit Badge Pamphlet for this requirement. It
            is strongly recommended that Scouts make notes of their
            findings by either marking their pamphlet or making notes on
            their Merit Badge Workbook for easy reference when explaining
            their findings to the counselor and/or class.

            Most of the injuries and illnesses listed in this requirement
            are recurring throughout a Scout's journey through rank and
            merit badges. Newer Scouts may need to spend more time than
            more advanced Scouts on this requirement. Scouts who are
            first class and above should find this a review of common
            first aid ailments and responses. Regardless, do not take
            this requirement for granted as most counselors will still
            want to validate that you remember and understand the details
            of this requirement. Be sure to follow the Boy Scout Motto
            and "Be Prepared" to explain your knowledge for consideration
            of completion on this requirement.

            There are two parts to this portion of requirement 1c. Both
            parts can be found by reviewing the Merit Badge Pamphlet. It
            is recommended that Scouts make notes of their findings and
            be prepared to share their results during the class. The
            first part of the requirement deals with the clothing and
            equipment necessary for cold weather and night time
            observations while the second part of the requirement

        This requirement can easily be prepared for through the reviewal of

        explanation can be found in the pamphlet for preparing for
        completion of this requirement. Finding the information however is
        only a part of the requirement. Scouts must actively be ready and
        successfully explain what is asked for in this requirement during
        the class in order to be considered for completion of this
        requirement.

        It is preferred that Scouts having their own binoculars and/or
        telescope (if practical) bring their equipment for use and
        demonstration during the class. Please note that it is the Scout's
        responsibility to manage and maintain their personal equipment and
        any damage or loss of these items is strictly the Scout's
        responsibility.

        NOTE: This requirement clearly states that the requirement
          components for requirement 3 need to be done with the aid of
          diagrams (or a real telescope). Scouts should have their diagrams
          ready for this requirement during the class. Be Prepared.

            Half of this requirement can easily be discovered and

            the Merit Badge Pamphlet. Scouts should be sure to have
            reviewed this section and be prepared the best way they can
            to explain their findings. If the Scout does not have a set
            of binoculars, there will be a pair for demonstration
            purposes available during the class to fulfill the second
            part of this requirement component.

            Scouts will find all they need to know to complete this
            requirement by reviewing the Merit Badge Pamphlet. The
            Counselor for the class will assist in further understanding
            through sharing of knowledge to ensure the Scout has a
            complete understanding in order to complete this requirement.
            The Counselors known expertise for this requirement should
            NOT be a reason Scouts minimize the importance of researching
            this requirement. Scouts still need to show that they have a

            to be considered for completion of this requirement.

            telescopes, Scouts should be prepared to share their
            understanding of at least three as the requirement states.
            The Counselor will help facilitate and explanatory discussion
            with all Scout participants in the class to complete this
            requirement. Active participation in this discussion is
            required and only Scouts who have come prepared AND actively

            requirement.

            in which they can share their understanding of this
            requirement. Only Scouts that actively participate in the

            the class will likely be able to complete this requirement.

        While Scouts will have an opportunity to share their work and research during the class discussion, however without preparation work, these requirement components will be impossible for Scouts to complete at or during the class.  Scouts should come to class with notes, drawings, sketches, and/or other documentation showing that they have completed their observations and identification of the required constellations and stars along with their sketches.

        NOTE: Stars and Constellations move about the sky depending on the time of year and time of night they are observed, so the tracking of date and time of the observation is crucial. Many online resources are available to aid in the identification of these stars and constellations. Drawing the constellation as it appears during your observation in the sky may be helpful as well. It must also be noted that just saying you have done these components of requirement 4 will NOT be enough to be signed off during the class. You must provide some sort of supporting documentation to the counselor to show that you have worked on and met the expectations of these components in Requirement 4.
