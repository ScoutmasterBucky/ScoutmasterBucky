Scouts will also need to actively partake in discussion to the satisfaction of the merit badge counselor in order to fulfill the first part of this requirement.{{/note}}
    a. Research and share with your counselor an individual you feel has demonstrated positive leadership while having to make an ethical decision. (It could be someone in history, a family member, a teacher, a coach, a counselor, a clergy member, a Scoutmaster, etc.)
    b. Explain what decision and/or options that leader had, why you believe they chose their final course of action, and the outcome of that action.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts will be provided time to share their research and findings on their chosen individual.  Only Scouts that are able to cover all points within this requirement will be considered for completion of this requirement.{{/note}}

4. Repeat the Scout Oath and Scout Law for your counselor. Choose two of the three following scenarios and discuss what you could do as a Scout to demonstrate leadership and your understanding of what it means to help others who may seem different from you:
    a. Scenario 1: While at camp, a youth accidentally spills food on another camper. The camper who gets spilled on gets angry and says something that is offensive to people with disabilities; their friends laugh. What could/should you do?
    b. Scenario 2: Your friend confides in you that some students in school are making insulting comments about one of their identities, and that those same students created a fake social media account to impersonate your friend online and post messages. What could/should you do?
    c. Scenario 3: A new student in your class was born in another country (or has a parent who was born in another country). Your friends make rude comments to the student about their speech or clothes and tell the student to "go back home where you came from." What could/should you do?
{{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts will work with other Scouts in the class in a small group to discuss these scenarios.

At lunchtime, you decide you’ll try to sit with a group to get to know other students. People at two tables tell you there is someone sitting at the currently empty seat at their table, so you end up eating by yourself.
            * How would that make you feel?
            * What could the students have done?
            * If that happened at your school, what would you do?
