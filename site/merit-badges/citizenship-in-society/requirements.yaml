            This requirement and its components will take some time to complete
            and Scouts MUST have these items prepared and readied for the
            class. Scouts not having this requirement prepared for prior to the
            class will be dismissed as the requirement clearly states,
            ***"Before beginning work on other requirement for this merit
            badge"***. Preparation is a must and those Scouts who do not
            prepare ahead of time for this requirement will NOT be able to
            partake in the class until this requirement is ready for
            completion.  Be Prepared!

            As the first part of this requirement states, Scouts must

            dictionary.com ***document = record (something) in written,
            photographic, or other form)***.  Failure to document will result
            in not being able to complete this requirement. Scouts will also
            need to actively partake in discussion to the satisfaction of the
            merit badge counselor in order to fulfill the first part of this
            requirement.

            teacher, a coach, a counselor, a clergy member, a Scoutmaster,

            Scouts should bring with them to class some sort of proof (a note

            counselor your preparation for this requirement as it states to do
            this requirement with the help of your parent or guardian. Scouts
            not able to show that they have done this requirement with their
            parent or guardian likely will find it difficult to meet the
            satisfaction of the counselor that the requirement was completed as

            their work for completion of this requirement during the class.
            Scouts may want to consider making notes in the Merit Badge
