{{#requirements}}
1. Do the following:
    (a) Explain to your counselor the most likely hazards you may encounter while participating in woodwork activities, and what you should do to anticipate, help prevent, mitigate, and respond to these hazards. Explain what precautions you should take to safely use your tools.
    (b) Show that you know first aid for injuries that could occur while woodworking, including splinters, scratches, cuts, severe bleeding, and shock. Tell what precautions must be taken to help prevent loss of eyesight or hearing, and explain why and when it is necessary to use a dust mask.
    {{#note type="online"}}Scouts will need to be prepared to "show" their first aid knowledge and skill for woodworking related injuries during the class.{{/note}}
    (c) Earn the Totinâ€™ Chip recognition.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts must complete ahead of time their Totin' Chip requirements and bring their current and up-to-date Totin' Chip Card with them to class. It is not acceptable to just say you have your Totin' Chip, you must bring proof.  For those that are not able to complete this ahead of time, Scouts will have an opportunity to complete this as a part of the class however this may affect their ability to complete other requirements in the class. Be Prepared.{{/note}}
2. Do the following:
    (a) Describe how timber is grown, harvested, and milled. Tell how lumber is cured, seasoned, graded, and sized.
    (b) Collect and label blocks of six kinds of wood useful in woodworking. Describe the chief qualities of each. Give the best uses of each.
    {{#note type="online"}}The counselor/instructor will facilitate discussion on thie requirement component, however Scouts must collect up their own wood blocks and be prepared to show that they have identified the blocks properly along with the qualities and uses for each.{{/note}}
3. Do the following:
    (a) Show proper care, use, and storage of all working tools and equipment that you own or use at home or school.
    {{#note type="online"}}This requirment component is not one that can be done quickly, as there are a lot of tools and equipment a woodworker might use and that are found in most households.  Scouts not showing a respectable effort in preparing for this requirement will find it difficult to gain sign off on this requirement component during the class.  Do your preparation work and use the merit badge pamphlet as a tool to be ready for sharing during class.{{/note}}
    (b) Sharpen correctly the cutting edges of two different tools.
    {{#note type="inPerson"}}While this requirement will be covered in the class, Scouts should still prepare with an understanding of the sharpening process nad methods by reviewing the merit badge pamphlet and being prepared to share their findings with the counselor.{{/note}}
    {{#note type="online"}}This requirement component should NOT be done without proper adult supervision and guidance. The online class will only provide for instruction on how to work on this requirement component after the class with adult supervision.  Scouts may choose to work on this requirement ahead of time (with adult supervision and guidance) for consideration of sign off during the class.{{/note}}
4. Use a saw, plane, plane, hammer, brace, and bit, make something useful of wood. Cut parts from lumber that you have squared and measured from working drawings.
{{#note type="inPerson"}}The materials and tools for this requirement will be provided by the merit badge counselor and worked on as a part of this class.{{/note}}
{{#note type="online"}}This requirement will not be done as a part of the online class, and any project work done should be done with proper adult supervision and guidance. While the counselor/intructor can share knowledge and insight during the class, this requirement must be done outside of the class.  Scouts should consider videoing or photographing the different steps of their work to share with the counselor/instructor when completed with this requirement.  Remember, this is YOUR project not someone else doing the work for you.{{/note}}
