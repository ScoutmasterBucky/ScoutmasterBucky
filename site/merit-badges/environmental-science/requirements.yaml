            This requirement will be covered in class through group discussion
            facilitated by the counselor.  Scouts should review the merit badge
            pamphlet prior to the class and make any notes that might aid them
            when asked to describe their findings. Active participation will be
            much easier if Scouts have notes to support their preparation for
            this requirement.

            Scouts should utilize a Merit Badge Workbook or other means of
            documenting their preparation.  It is highly recommended Scouts
            come to the class with these terms already defined so that they
            spend their time sharing and completing this requirement in a
            timely manner during the class instead of trying to write their
            answers out during the class.  All definitions can easily be found
            in the Merit Badge Pamphlet or online.

            Some of these will be covered in the class however 3D and 3F will
            only be partially covered.  Scouts must complete preparation work
            and bring their work to class in order to be considered for
            completion.  Make sure you are prepared.

            Scouts should choose an item from 3a, 3b, 3c, 3e, or 3h to come to
            class prepared to share, discuss, explain, or demonstrate as noted
            in the requirement component areas. .

            It is recommended that Scouts should do 3d3. Photograph an area
            affected by erosion. These photos will be shared during the class.
            Scouts will discuss why the area has eroded, and what might be done
            to alleviate erosion.

            It is recommended that Scouts should do 3f2.  Determine 10 ways to
            conserve resources or use resources more efficiently in your home,
            at school, or at camp.

            It is recommended that you write these down on paper for use during
            the class. Practice at least 2 of these methods for 7 days. Scouts
            will discuss what they have learned from this during the class.

            REMEMBER - This is an Eagle-required merit badge and completion of
            these requirements is not solely reliant on being spoon-fed the
            information.  Only Scouts who have prepared and put effort into
            this merit badge and its preparation will be signed off on the
            respective requirements and components A.

                  The counselor has recommended that Scouts attending the class
                  consider doing 4a.  Bring your work to class for discussion
                  and sharing. You will not be able to complete this
                  requirement without proof of work.  Scouts not completing
                  this requirement prior to the class will be provided with a
                  merit badge counselor contact for follow up after the class
                  once they have completed this requirement.

            Make at least three visits to each of the two study areas (for a
            total of six visits), staying for at least 20 minutes each time, to
            observe the living and nonliving parts of the ecosystem. Space each
            visit far enough apart that there are readily apparent differences
            in the observations. Keep a journal that includes the differences
            you observe. Then, write a short report that adequately addresses
            your observations, including how the differences of the study areas
            might relate to the differences noted, and discuss this with your
            counselor.
