{{#requirements}}
1. Make a timeline of the history of environmental science in America. Identify the contribution made by the Boy Scouts of America to environmental science. Include dates, names of people or organizations, and important events.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}This requirement will be covered in class through group discussion facilitated by the counselor.  Scouts should review the merit badge pamphlet prior to the class and make any notes that might aid them when asked to describe their findings. Active participation will be much easier if Scouts have notes to support their preparation for this requirement.{{/note}}
2. Define the following terms: population, community, ecosystem, biosphere, symbiosis, niche, habitat, conservation, threatened species, endangered species, extinction, pollution prevention, brownfield, ozone, watershed, airshed, nonpoint source, hybrid vehicle, fuel cell.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should utilize a Merit Badge Workbook or other means of documenting their preparation.  It is highly recommended Scouts come to the class with these terms already defined so that they spend their time sharing and completing this requirement in a timely manner during the class instead of trying to write their answers out during the class.  All definitions can easily be found in the Merit Badge Pamphlet or online.{{/note}}
3. Do ONE activity from seven of the following categories (using the activities in this pamphlet as the basis for planning and projects):
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Some of these will be covered in the class however 3D and 3F will only be partially covered.  Scouts must complete preparation work and bring their work to class in order to be considered for completion.  Make sure you are prepared.{{/note}}
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should choose an item from 3a, 3b, 3c, 3e, or 3h to come to class prepared to share, discuss, explain, or demonstrate as noted in the requirement component areas. .{{/note}}
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}It is recommended that Scouts should do 3d3. Photograph an area affected by erosion. These photos will be shared during the class. Scouts will discuss why the area has eroded, and what might be done to alleviate erosion.{{/note}}
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}It is recommended that Scouts should do 3f2.  Determine 10 ways to conserve resources or use resources more efficiently in your home, at school, or at camp.{{/note}}
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}It is recommended that you write these down on paper for use during the class. Practice at least 2 of these methods for 7 days. Scouts will discuss what they have learned from this during the class.{{/note}}
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}REMEMBER - This is an Eagle-required merit badge and completion of these requirements is not solely reliant on being spoon-fed the information.  Only Scouts who have prepared and put effort into this merit badge and its preparation will be signed off on the respective requirements and components A.{{/note}}
    (a) Ecology
        (1) Conduct an experiment to find out how living things respond to changes in their environments. Discuss your observations with your counselor.
        (2) Conduct an experiment illustrating the greenhouse effect. Keep a journal of your data and observations. Discuss your conclusions with your counselor.
        (3) Discuss what is an ecosystem. Tell how it is maintained in nature and how it survives.
    (b) Air Pollution
        (1) Perform an experiment to test for particulates that contribute to air pollution. Discuss your findings with your counselor.
        (2) Record the trips taken, mileage, and fuel consumption of a family car for seven days, and calculate how many miles per gallon the car gets. Determine whether any trips could have been combined ("chained") rather than taken out and back. Using the idea of trip chaining, determine how many miles and gallons of gas could have been saved in those seven days.
        (3) Explain what is acid rain. In your explanation, tell how it affects plants and the environment and the steps society can take to help reduce its effects.
    (c) Water Pollution
        (1) Conduct an experiment to show how living things react to thermal pollution. Discuss your observations with your counselor.
        (2) Conduct an experiment to identify the methods that could be used to mediate (reduce) the effects of an oil spill on waterfowl. Discuss your results with your counselor.
        (3) Describe the impact of a waterborne pollutant on an aquatic community. Write a 100-word report on how that pollutant affected aquatic life, what the effect was, and whether the effect is linked to biomagnification.
    (d) Land Pollution
        (1) Conduct an experiment to illustrate soil erosion by water. Take photographs or make a drawing of the soil before and after your experiment, and make a poster showing your results. Present your poster to your counselor.
        (2) Perform an experiment to determine the effect of an oil spill on land. Discuss your conclusions with your counselor.
        (3) Photograph an area affected by erosion. Share your photographs with your counselor and discuss why the area has eroded and what might be done to help alleviate the erosion.
    (e) Endangered Species
        (1) Do research on one endangered species found in your state. Find out what its natural habitat is, why it is endangered, what is being done to preserve it, and how many individual organisms are left in the wild. Prepare a 100-word report about the organism, including a drawing. Present your report to your patrol or troop.
        (2) Do research on one species that was endangered or threatened but that has now recovered. Find out how the organism recovered, and what its new status is. Write a 100-word report on the species and discuss it with your counselor.
        (3) With your parent's and counselor's approval, work with a natural resource professional to identify two projects that have been approved to improve the habitat for a threatened or endangered species in your area. Visit the site of one of these projects and report on what you saw.
    (f) Pollution Prevention, Resource Recovery, and Conservation
        (1) Look around your home and determine 10 ways your family can help reduce pollution. Practice at least two of these methods for seven days and discuss with your counselor what you have learned.
        (2) Determine 10 ways to conserve resources or use resources more efficiently in your home, at school, or at camp. Practice at least two of these methods for seven days and discuss with your counselor what you have learned.
        (3) Perform an experiment on packaging materials to find out which ones are biodegradable. Discuss your conclusion with your counselor.
    (g) Pollination
        (1) Using photographs or illustrations, point out the differences between a drone and a worker bee. Discuss the stages of bee development (eggs, larvae, pupae). Explain the pollination process, and what propolis is and how it is used by honey bees. Tell how bees make honey and beeswax, and how both are harvested. Explain the part played in the life of the hive by the queen, the drones, and the workers.
        (2) Present your counselor a one-page report on how and why honeybees are used in pollinating food crops. In your report, discuss the problems faced by the bee population today, and the impact to humanity if there were no pollinators. Share your report with your troop or patrol, your class at school, or another group approved by your counselor.
        **Before you choose requirement 3g(3), you will need to first find out whether you are allergic to bee stings. Visit an allergist or your family physician to find out. If you are allergic to bee stings, you should choose another option within requirement 3. In completing requirement 3g(3), your counselor can help you find an established beekeeper to meet with you and your buddy. Ask whether you can help hive a swarm or divide a colony of honey bees. Before your visit, be sure your buddy is not allergic to bee stings. For help with locating a beekeeper in your state, visit the <a href="https://www.beeculture.com/directory/">Bee Culture Directory</a>.**
        (3) Hive a swarm or divide at least one colony of honey bees. Explain how a hive is constructed.
    (h) Invasive Species
        (1) Learn to identify the major invasive plant species in your community or camp and explain to your counselor what can be done to either eradicate or control their spread.
        (2) Do research on two invasive plant or animal species in your community or camp. Find out where the species originated, how they were transported to the United States, their life history, how they are spread, and the recommended means to eradicate or control their spread. Report your research orally or in writing to your counselor.
        (3) Take part in a project of at least one hour to eradicate or control the spread of an invasive plant species in your community or camp.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}SEE NOTES ABOVE - See Notes under the first part of Requirement 3.{{/note}}
4. Choose two outdoor study areas that are very different from one another (e.g., hilltop vs. bottom of a hill; field vs. forest; swamp vs. dry land). For BOTH study areas, do ONE of the following:
    (a) Mark off a plot of 4 square yards in each study area, and count the number of species found there. Estimate how much space is occupied by each plant species and the type and number of nonplant species you find. Report to your counselor orally or in writing the biodiversity and population density of these study areas.
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}The counselor has recommended that Scouts attending the class consider doing 4a.  Bring your work to class for discussion and sharing. You will not be able to complete this requirement without proof of work.  Scouts not completing this requirement prior to the class will be provided with a merit badge counselor contact for follow up after the class once they have completed this requirement.{{/note}}
    (b) Make at least three visits to each of the two study areas (for a total of six visits), staying for at least 20 minutes each time, to observe the living and nonliving parts of the ecosystem. Space each visit far enough apart that there are readily apparent differences in the observations. Keep a journal that includes the differences you observe. Discuss your observations with your counselor.
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}This requirement will NOT be covered in the class.  Scouts having prepared and done this requirement will have an opportunity to review this component of the requirement with the counselor after the class for consideration of completion.  Bring your work, just saying you did it is not enough. No time during the class will be allotted for starting work on this component of Requirement 4.{{/note}}
5. Using the construction project provided or a plan you create on your own, identify the items that would need to be included in an environmental impact statement for the project planned.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}This Requirement will be covered in the class, however Scouts should review their Merit Badge Pamphlet prior to the class to familiarize themselves with the requirement and what completion will entail.  Only Scout who are attentive, prepared, and actively participate in the class will have the opportunity of completing this requirement.{{/note}}
6. Find out about three career opportunities in environmental science. Pick one and find out the education, training, and experience required for this profession. Discuss this with your counselor, and explain why this profession might interest you.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should review this requirement and its components and be prepared to discuss. Each Scout will be asked to share their choice of career opportunities along with the education, training, and experience required for their choice.{{/note}}
