{{#requirements}}
1. Discuss with your counselor what citizenship in the community means and what it takes to be a good citizen in your community. Discuss the rights, duties, and obligations of citizenship, and explain how you can demonstrate good citizenship in your community, Scouting unit, place of worship, or school.
{{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should be prepared prior to the class. They should consider having this written out to show the counselor that some thought and research has gone into this requirement and Scouts should be prepared to discuss their findings. Scouts will not automatically be signed off on this requirement just for attending as the requirement states that they must discuss a number of items and will be required to partake in group and/or individual discussion to obtain credit.{{/note}}
2. Do the following:
    (a) On a map of your community, locate and point out the following:
        (1) Chief government buildings such as your city hall, county courthouse, and public works/services facilities
        (2) Fire station, police station, and hospital nearest your home
        (3) Parks, playgrounds, recreation areas, and trails
        (4) Historical or other interesting points of interest
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should be prepared to share their findings with the class and should be prepared with this requirement prior to the class. Scouts should come with their map; a fold out map of their community or one printed out (detailed size) from the Internet. Scouts need to make sure they have components from all four requirements in 2a marked on the map.{{/note}}
    (b) Chart the organization of your local or state government. Show the top offices and tell whether they are elected or appointed.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}For requirement 2b, Scouts may choose either their local or state government to outline. It is preferred if Scouts would choose their local government as class discussion will include a discussion component comparing the similarities and differences between local governments of each participant.{{/note}}
3. Do the following:
    (a) Attend a meeting of your city, town, or county council or school board; OR attend a municipal, county, or state court session.
    (b) Choose one of the issues discussed at the meeting where a difference of opinions was expressed, and explain to your counselor why you agree with one opinion more than you do another one.
{{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}While most counselors would prefer you do requirement 3a in person, reviewing a cable broadcast of one of these meetings is also acceptable. Scouts should come prepared to discuss their findings with the counselor and the class. Make sure to include the date, time, place of the meeting with any notes.{{/note}}
4. Choose an issue that is important to the citizens of your community; then do the following:
    (a) Find out which branch of local government is responsible for this issue.
    (b) With your counselor's and a parent's approval, interview one person from the branch of government you identified in requirement 4a. Ask what is being done about this issue and how young people can help.
    (c) Share what you have learned with your counselor.
{{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should review this requirement and its components and be prepared to discuss. It is strongly recommended that Scouts bring any notes or supporting documents they may have to help show the counselor that they have prepared for discussion of these items. Requirement 4B may be done prior to or after the class, however, sign off will only be done after completion of the entire requirement.{{/note}}
5. With the approval of your counselor and a parent, watch a movie that shows how the actions of one individual or group of individuals can have a positive effect on a community. Discuss with your counselor what you learned from the movie about what it means to be a valuable and concerned member of the community.
{{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts may choose a movie to watch and prepare their work for review by the Counselor. Wise movie selection is important.  Some movies that have been approved by many Counselors in the past include:

		• 12 Angry Men		• Going My Way          • Pay It Forward
		• A Bug's Life		• Hoosiers              • Radio
		• Avatar    		• Hoot                  • Ready Player One
		• Boycott		    • It's A Wonderful Life • Remember the Titans
		• Coach Carter		• Lean On Me            • The Right Stuff
		• Erin Brockovich	• The Majestic          • Spartacus
		• Follow Me Boys	• The Mighty Ducks      • Stand and Deliver
		• Footloose 		• Miracle               • Star Wars IV - A New Hope
		• Forrest Gump		• Mr Holland's Opus     • Take the Lead
		• Gandhi    		• October Sky           • To Kill a Mockingbird
Please note that while all of these movies have been used in other Citizenship in the Community classes, Scouts, parents, and Counselors vary and may find some of these choices not to their liking.  Please review the movie rating and summary prior to selecting one of these movies.

Scouts will find that most Counselors will accept one of these listed movies for completion of this requirement.  Scouts should make thorough notes to aid them in their discussion with the Counselor during the class.{{/note}}

{{#note type="inPerson"}}A movie will be presented as a part of this class for those Scouts who attend not having this requirement ready for review by the counselor. Scouts will be encouraged to view the movie if they have not prepared for this requirement or their previous work does not meet the satisfaction of the counselor.{{/note}}
6. List some of the services (such as the library, recreation center, public transportation, and public safety) your community provides that are funded by taxpayers. Tell your counselor why these services are important to your community.
{{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should come to the class with a knowledge of what services are available in their community and be prepared for discussion of this requirement in the class.{{/note}}
7. Do the following:
    (a) Identify three charitable organizations outside of Scouting that interest you and bring people in your community together to work for the good of your community.
    (b) Pick ONE of the organizations you chose for requirement 7a. Using a variety of resources (including newspapers, fliers and other literature, the Internet, volunteers, and employees of the organization), find out more about this organization.
    (c) With your counselor's and your parent's approval, contact the organization you chose for requirement 7b, and find out what young people can do to help. While working on this merit badge, volunteer at least eight hours of your time for the organization. After your volunteer experience is over, discuss what you have learned with your counselor.
{{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts may choose to complete this requirement ahead of time or complete this after the class. The class will focus some time into the discussion of opportunities that Scouts have selected to do as well as some ideas for those who are still looking for ideas to complete this requirement.
Scouts wishing to begin or complete their volunteering before the class must email or call Scoutmaster Bucky (ScoutmasterBucky@yahoo.com) to verify that their chosen organization meets the requirements. Acceptable organizations include nonprofit, religious, or governmental units.
Please note: Religious organizations are acceptable as long as your volunteering does NOT involve disseminating religious information or trying to convert people to that particular faith.  While these are important outreach activities of religion, they do not fulfill the requirements for this merit badge.{{/note}}
8. Develop a public presentation (such as a video, slide show, speech, digital presentation, or photo exhibit) about important and unique aspects of your community. Include information about the history, cultures, and ethnic groups of your community; its best features and popular places where people gather; and the challenges it faces. Stage your presentation in front of your merit badge counselor or a group, such as your patrol or a class at school.
{{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should review this requirement and its components and be prepared for presenting in the class. Counselors will allot time within the class for all Scouts to make their presentations.{{/note}}
