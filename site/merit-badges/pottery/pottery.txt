Acknowledgments
The Boy Scouts of America gives
special thanks to pottery expert Louise
Rosenfield for her gracious and enthusi-
astic gift of time, expertise, and resources
for the production of this edition of the
Pottery merit badge pamphlet.
The BSA is grateful to artisan potter
Mark Hewitt of W. M. Hewitt Pottery,
Pittsboro, North Carolina, for hosting
a photo shoot at his fascinating studio.
Some of the photos in this pamphlet
feature his immense, 900-cubic-foot kiln,
which he describes as “the size of a
school bus.” This renowned potter spe-
cializes in very large vessels, many of
which are exhibited around the world.
Thanks also to the Craft Guild of
Dallas and its staff for so generously
allowing us the use of their facilities for
a photo shoot. For more than 50 years
the Craft Guild has served as a meeting
place for hobbyists and artists, and as a
showplace for their works of art.
The BSA thanks members of Troop
93, Pittsboro, North Carolina, and
Troop 890, Circle Ten Council, Dallas,
Texas, for their assistance with photos.
