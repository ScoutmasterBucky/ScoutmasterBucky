      Note to the Counselor: Counselors should also ensure that Scouts follow
      the Leave No Trace Seven Principles and the Outdoor Code in their
      pioneering projects. Just as hiking and camping without a trace are signs
      of expert outdoorsmanship, protecting the environment is a mark of
      responsible pioneering. Minimize impacts to the land.
