7. With a companion, use a properly equipped canoe to demonstrate the following:
(a) Safely carry and launch the canoe from a dock or shore (both, if possible).
(b) Safely land the canoe on a dock or shore (both, if possible) and return it
to its proper storage location.
(c) Demonstrate kneeling and sitting positions in a canoe and explain the
proper use for each position.
(d) Change places while afloat in the canoe.
8. With a companion, use a properly equipped canoe to demonstrate the following:
(a) Safely exit the canoe in deep water without losing contact with the canoe.
Reenter the canoe with the assistance of the other paddler without capsizing
the boat.
(b) Safely perform a controlled capsize of the canoe and demonstrate how
staying with a capsized canoe will support both paddlers.
(c) Swim, tow, or push a swamped canoe 50 feet to shallow water. In the
shallow water, empty the swamped canoe and reenter it.
(d) In deep water, rescue a swamped canoe and its paddlers. After checking
that those in the water do not need immediate assistance, empty the
swamped canoe and help the paddlers safely reenter their boat without
capsizing.
(e) Perform a canoe rescue of a conscious swimmer.

conscious swimmer 30 feet away. Show how to repack the bag when done.
9. With a companion, using a properly equipped canoe to demonstrate the
following tandem maneuvers while paddling in unison on opposite sides and
without changing sides. Each paddler must demonstrate these maneuvers in
both the bow and stern and on both sides of the canoe while maintaining
trim and balance of the canoe:
(a) Pivot (spin) the canoe 180Â° (half circle) to the right from a stationary
position, stop, and return to the starting position by pivoting to the left using
draw and pushaway strokes or using forward and reverse sweeps staying
within 2 boat lengths of the starting position.
(b) Move a canoe sideways (abeam) in one direction for 10 feet and then
return to the starting position using the draw and pushaway strokes.
(c) While in forward motion, stop the canoe within two boat lengths using
the backstroke.
(d) While in the stern position and without assistance from the bow paddler,
paddle in a straight line 15-20 boat lengths using an appropriate steering stroke,
e.g., the J-stroke or thumb-down rudder stroke with or without a stern pry.
(e) Move the canoe in a straight line 15-20 boat lengths with the bow paddler
using as necessary the forward stroke, draw stroke or forward sweep and the
stern paddler using an appropriate steering stroke, e.g., the J-stroke or thumb-
down rudder stroke with or without a stern pry.
