      If meeting any of the requirements for this merit badge is against the
      Scout's religious convictions, the requirement does not have to be done
      if the Scout's parents and the proper religious advisors state in writing
      that to do so would be against religious convictions. The Scout's parents
      must also accept full responsibility for anything that might happen
      because of this exemption.

                  Scouts should review the merit badge pamphlet for this
                  requirement as all the required knowledge and recommendations
                  will be found within the contents of the Atheltics Merit
                  Badge pamphlet for this requirement component. It is strongly

                  either marking their pamphlet or making notes in their Merit

                  Most of the injuries and illnesses listed in this requirement
                  component are recurring throughout a Scout's journey through
                  rank and merit badges. Newer Scouts may need to spend more
                  time than more advanced Scouts on this requirement component.
                  Scouts who are first class and above should find this a
                  review of common first aid ailments and responses.
                  Regardless, do not take this requirement component for
                  granted as most counselors will still want to validate that
                  you remember and understand the details of this requirement
                  component. Be sure to follow the Scout Motto and "Be

            Preparing for the class for this requirement can easily be done by
            reviewing the Merit Badge Pamphlet for guidance.  Scouts are
            encouraged to not only use the Merit Badge Pamphlet's insight to
            these items in the requirement but to also form their own
            conclusions and ideas for completing this requirement. It is
            recommended that Scouts make notes to reference during the class
            when providing their explanations.  This will ensure a higher
            probability of completing this requirement in the time allotted
            during the class.

            out with your coach or trainer for the particular your selected
            athletic activity. Utilize this as a starting point to share with
            the counselor. Be sure to have an accurate and detailed chart and
            approach. You may find that adjustments to your plan are necessary
            as you proceed, and these things should be noted when reviewing
            with the counselor. At the end of your tracking it should be
            evident the progress you have made and allow for easy completion of
            this requirement. Make sure you chart and document as this is the
            only way you will be able to complete the requirement.

                  While the remaining parts of Requirement 4 will be discussed

                  this requirement so that they are prepared and knowledgeable
                  for explanation and discussion. Scouts not having reviewed

            Scouts will need to figure out how to show, share, and prove to the
            counselor / instructor that they not only have practiced /
            participated in their four selected options, but they will also
            need to show some sort of charting, tracking, or documentation on
            how they have improved in each. It is not enough to simply say you
            have done these activities, it is your responsibility to share with
            the counselor / instructor proof that you have met the expectations
            of the requirement. Be Prepared.
