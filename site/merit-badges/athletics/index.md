{{#requirements}}
If meeting any of the requirements for this merit badge is against the Scout's religious convictions, the requirement does not have to be done if the Scout's parents and the proper religious advisors state in writing that to do so would be against religious convictions. The Scout's parents must also accept full responsibility for anything that might happen because of this exemption.
1. Do the following:
    (a) Explain to your counselor the most likely hazards you may encounter during athletics activities, and what you should do to anticipate, help prevent, mitigate, and respond to these hazards.
    (b) Show that you know first aid for injuries or illnesses that could occur while participating in athletics events, including sprains, strains, contusions, abrasions, blisters, dehydration, and heat reactions.
2. Do the following:
    (a) Before completing requirements 3 and 5, have your health-care practitioner give you a physical examination, using the Scout medical examination form.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts must bring their current and up-to-date BSA Medical Form (parts A, B, and C) in order to be able to be reviewed on any further requirements during the class. Failure to have a current and endorsed BSA Medical Form will NOT allow Scouts to continue working on Requirements 3 thru 5 of this merit badge.{{/note}}
    (b) Explain the importance of a physical exam.
    (c) Explain the importance of maintaining good health habits, especially during training-and how the use of tobacco products, alcohol, and other harmful substances can negatively affect your health and your performance in athletic activities.
    (d) Explain the importance of maintaining a healthy diet.
3. Select an athletic activity that interests you, then do the following:
    (a) With guidance from your counselor, establish a personal training program suited to the activity you have chosen. Follow this training program for three months.
    (b) Create a chart to monitor your progress during this time.
    (c) Explain to your counselor the equipment necessary to participate in this activity and the appropriate clothing for the time of year.
    (d) At the end of four months, review the chart you created for requirement 3b, and discuss with your counselor what progress you have made during training. Tell how your development has affected you mentally and physically.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Most counselors will accept a program that you have worked out with your coach or trainer for your selected athletic activity. Make sure you have charted and documented your progress over the four month period of training.{{/note}}
4. Do the following:
    (a) Give the rules for two athletic activities, one of which is the activity you chose for requirement 3.
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Requirement 4a is partially dependent on your selection in requirement 3. While time will be allotted in the class to discuss this requirement component, realize that each class participant may have two different athletic activities that they have selected, and all may be different from yours. Scouts should be prepared to share their two selected athletic activities for this requirement during the class and have ready a short summary of the rules related to these activities. Scouts will be able to complete this part of requirement 4 with proper planning and preparation as well as sharing with the counselor / instructor during the class.{{/note}}
    (b) Discuss the importance of warming up and cooling down.
    (c) Explain to your counselor what an amateur athlete is and the differences between an amateur and a professional athlete.
    (d) Discuss the traits and importance of good sportsmanship. Tell what role sportsmanship plays in both individual and group athletic activities.
5. Complete the activities in FOUR of the following groups and show improvement over a three-month period:
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts will need to figure out how to show, share, and prove to the counselor / instructor that they not only have practiced / participated in their four selected options, but they will also need to show some sort of charting, tracking, or documentation on how they have improved in each. It is not enough to simply say you have done these activities, it is your responsibility to share with the counselor / instructor proof that you have met the expectations of the requirement. Be Prepared.{{/note}}
