Requirements
1. Do the following:
a. Explain to your counselor the most likely hazards you
may encounter while working with composite materi-
als and what you should do to anticipate, mitigate and
prevent, and respond to these hazards. Describe the
appropriate safety gear and clothing that should be
used when working with composite materials.
b. Explain the precautions that must be taken when
handling, storing, and disposing of resins, reinforce-
ments, and other materials used in composites. Include
in your discussion the importance of health, safety,
and environmental responsibility and awareness.
c. Describe what a material safety data sheet (MSDS) is
and tell why it is used.
2. Do the following:
a. Explain what composite materials are. Include a brief
history of composites and how they have developed.
b. Compare the similarities and differences between
composites and wood, aluminum, copper, and steel.
Describe the physical, electrical, mechanical, corrosive,
flammability, cost, and other such properties. For each
of these raw materials, give one example of how it
can be shaped and used for a specific application.
3. Describe how composite materials are made. Then do
the following:
a. Discuss three different composite reinforcement
materials, their positive and negative characteristics,
and their uses. Obtain the MSDS for each one and
discuss the toxicity, disposal, and safe-handling
sections for these materials.

b. Discuss three different resins used in composites,
their positive and negative characteristics, and their
uses. Obtain the MSDS for each one and discuss
the toxicity, disposal, and safe-handling sections
for these materials. Include thermoset resins and
thermoplastic resins in your discussion.
c. For each of the three resins you chose for require-
ment 3b, think of a new application that might be
worth developing.
4. With your parent’s permission and your counselor’s
approval, do ONE of the following:
a. Visit a company that manufactures or repairs
products made with composites. Discuss what
you learn with your counselor.
b. Find three composites-related websites. Share and
discuss what you learn with your counselor.
5. Do the following:
a. Use composite materials to complete two projects, at
least one of which must come from the Composite
Materials merit badge pamphlet. The second project
may come from the pamphlet OR may be one you
select on your own that has been approved by your
counselor in advance.
b. With your counselor’s assistance, find an appropriate
site where the projects can be safely completed under
your counselor’s supervision and/or the supervision
of an adult approved by your counselor who is
knowledgeable about composites.
c. With your counselor, determine how the finished
projects will be evaluated. Using those guidelines,
evaluate the completed projects with your counselor.
6. Find out about three career opportunities in composite
materials. Pick one and find out the education, training,
and experience required for this profession. Discuss this
with your counselor, and explain why this profession
might interest you.
