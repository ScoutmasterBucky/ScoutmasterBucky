        Scouts are encouraged to prepare ahead of time if they know someone
        who is an engineer.  While the merit badge counselor will help
        facilitate this requirement during the class, it is appreciated
        when Scouts can bring diversity to the class discussion with
        personalized research to share during the class discussion on the
        components of this requirement.  Scouts, at a minimum should review
        this requirement and have an understanding of each of the aspects
        of this requirement.  It should not be expected that Scouts who
        have not reviewed this requirement will be signed off during the
        class.  There is some level of preparation that can and should be
        done prior to the class, even if there is not someone that they can
        interview prior to the class.  Formulating some questions to ask
        should be the minimum preparation done prior to the class for this
        requirement.

        Scouts should review each of these concepts in the requirement by
        reviewing the merit badge pamphlet prior to the class.  The
        counselor will choose two of the components of this requirement to
        focus on during the class (counselor choice), however Scouts should
        be prepared by understanding the basic concepts of each of these
        components by reviewing the merit badge pamphlet.  Scouts attending
        the class who cannot satisfactorily show that they have reviewed
        for this requirement prior to the class will find it difficult to
        complete this requirement. The counselor will assist in completing
        this requirement but only if the Scouts can show they have a core
        understanding coming into the class. Be Prepared.

        utilizing a merit badge workbook to help organize their notes while
        preparing for this requirement.  These notes will be helpful to
        reference during the class discussion..
