        <p><span class="C(red)">It is not adequate to just say that you have done this requirement.  Scouts should have proof of their two-month dog care responsibilities, and like the requirement states, have a log showing their efforts.  Scouts must also remember to provide a description of the type of housing/shelter provided for their dog. Have your log and description ready for the class to share with your counselor and fellow Scouts.</span></p>
        <p><span class="C(red)">NOTE: If you have been following the same routine raising your dog, the requirement does not say you cannot "backlog".  The logging does not need to start the day you started the merit badge, but most counselors will prefer a more recent set of logs.</span></p>
    - req: 5
      text: |-
        <p><span class="C(red)">Scouts will need to have their dog with them in order to complete this requirement.</span></p>
        <p><span class="C(red)">It is acceptable to have video of you and your dog performing these commands.  Be prepared for the class to share your dog's obedience and give explanation on proper obedience training.</span></p>
    - req: 7
      text: |-
        <p><span class="C(red)">While this requirement will be covered in the class, Scouts should still prepare by understanding the basics of each component in this requirement by reviewing the merit badge pamphlet and being prepared to explain their findings with the counselor.</span></p>
        <p><span class="C(red)">Requirement components 7b and 7d will require "showing" in order to complete, and Scouts will need the proper resources at hand in order to complete during the class. Be prepared!</span></p>
    - req: 8
      text: |-
        <p><span class="C(red)">The veterinary visit is NOT done as a part of the class, HOWEVER...</span></p>
        <p><span class="C(red)">Scouts may choose to complete this requirement ahead of time or complete this after the class. The class will focus some time for discussion of this requirement. Scouts that have completed their visit, and can substantiate that with the counselor, will have an opportunity to complete this part of the requirement during the class.</span></p>
    - req: 9
      text: |-
        <p><span class="C(red)">Scouts will need to prepare for this requirement prior to the class by researching their local laws and ordinances in their community.  Scouts should be prepared with their findings to share during the class.</span></p>
bring:
    - your dog (if possible) - <b><i>for online classes:</b></i> you will need your dog midway through the class. <b><i>for in-person classes:</b></i> (please have your parents come with you so they may remove the dog when certain requirements are completed and to help maintain control of your dog)
