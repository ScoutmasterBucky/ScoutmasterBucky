      NOTE: Scouts must not use venomous reptiles in fulfilling requirement 8a.
      When you decide keeping your specimen is no longer possible or desired, be
      sure to find another appropriate home for it or return it to the wild at
      the location of capture. Check with your counselor for those instances
      where the return of these specimens would not be appropriate. Under the
      Endangered Species Act of 1973, some plants and animals are, or may be,
      protected by federal law. The same ones and/or others may be protected by
      state law. Be sure that you do not collect protected species. Your state
      may require that you purchase and carry a license to collect certain
      species. Check with the wildlife and fish and game officials in your state
      regarding species regulations before you begin to collect.

        (a) Take custody of one or more reptiles or amphibians in a manner

        for at least a month. Record food accepted, eating methods, changes in
        coloration, shedding of skins, and general habits; or keep the eggs of a
        reptile from the time of laying until hatching; or keep the eggs of an
        amphibian from the time of laying until their transformation into
        tadpoles (frogs) or larvae (salamanders). Whichever you chose, keep
        records of and report to your counselor how you cared for your
        animal/eggs/larvae to include lighting, habitat, temperature and
        humidity maintenance and any veterinary care requirements. Unless you

        periods of three months. At each visit, sketch the specimen in its
        captive habitat and note any changes in its coloration, shedding of
        skins, and general habits and behavior. Discuss with your counselor how
        the animal you observed was cared for to include its housing and

        eats and what are its native habitat and home range, preferred climate,
        average life expectancy, and natural predators. Also identify any
        human-caused threats to its population and any laws that protect the
        species and its habitat. After the observation period, share what you
        have learned with your counselor.
