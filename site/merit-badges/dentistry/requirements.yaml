            Scouts will have an opportunity to complete this requirement during
            the class.  Before the class Scouts will need to work with their
            parents and visit a dentist and arrange for a dental examination.
            Bringing proof to the class is important to help show the counselor
            / instructor that the requirement has been worked on.  While a
            dental bill or slip will show that Scouts have visited their
            dentist, this is only part of the requirement.  As the requirement
            states Scouts are to ask questions of the dentist about things they
            want to know or observe during their visit.  It is strongly
            recommended that Scouts get a note from their dentist stating
            specifically their visit, as well as discussion, to ensure proper
            sign off on this requirement may be considered.
