            Scouts should review the merit badge pamphlet and utilize a Merit
            Badge Workbook when preparing for this requirement. Scouts will
            find it very helpful to have these notes organized and ready for
            sharing during the class as they may find it difficult to record
            this information during the class and fall behind the discussion
            trying to keep up with taking notes. Having this prepared for ahead
            of time will ensure completion of this requirement within the class
            allotted time.

            This requirement will be covered and managed by the counselor in
            the class. The counselor will likely focus on only one of these
            options; naturally biased towards their area of interest and
            expertise. Scouts however are encouraged to review the merit badge
            pamphlet with this requirement in mind to familiarize themselves
            with differences in each of these areas for the different animals.
            This familiarization will help created a better understanding and
            discussion in the class with the counselor and other Scouts.

            While the merit badge pamphlet can give some perspective on each of

            *PLEASE NOTE:* **For Requirement #6 when attending a Scoutmaster
            Bucky class, the option to prepare for will be noted within the
            registration information of the class. If you are uncertain which
            option will be covered within the class, please ask for
            clarification. Scouts will be expected to have prepared the
            appropriate components of the Requirement #6 option that is
            designated for the the class. In-person classes are usually focused
            specifically on one these options specifically and the counselor
            may not be serving this merit badge for all options listed.**

            Some counselors however may be able to accommodate all options, so
            please pay close attention to the class offering, and ask for
            clarification if you are uncertain.

                  Scouts will need to do some research and reading in order to

                  make notes of their findings to help show the counselor their
                  efforts in preparing for the class. These notes can also
                  serve to help Scouts successfully perform their explanation
                  or discussion elements of this requirement. It will be very
