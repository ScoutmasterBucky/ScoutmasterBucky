ANIMAL SCIENCE

“Enhancing our youths’ competitive edge through merit badges”

Animal Science
1. Name four breeds of livestock in each of the following classifications: horses,
dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep, hogs. Tell their principal uses and merits.
Tell where the breeds originated.
2. List five diseases that afflict the animals in each of the classifications in requirement 1. Also list five diseases of poultry. Describe the symptoms of each
disease and explain how each is contracted and how it could be prevented.
3. Explain the differences in the digestive systems of ruminants, horses, pigs, and
poultry. Explain how the differences in structure and function among these
types of digestive tracts affect the nutritional management of these species.
4. Select one type of animal—beef cow, dairy cow, horse, sheep, goat, or hog, or
a poultry flock—and tell how you would properly manage it. Include in your
discussion nutritional (feeding) concerns, housing, disease prevention, waste
control/removal, breeding programs, and biosecurity as appropriate.
5. Explain the importance of setting clear goals for any animal breeding program.
Tell how purebred lines of animals are produced. Explain the practice of crossbreeding and the value of this practice.
6. Complete ONE of the following options:

Beef Cattle Option
(a) Visit a farm or ranch where beef cattle are produced under any of
these systems:
(1) Feeding market cattle for harvest
(2) Cow/calf operation, producing cattle for sale to commercial feeders
(3) Producing purebred cattle for sale as breeding stock to others
Talk with the operator to learn how the cattle were handled, fed, weighed, and
shipped. Describe what you saw and explain what you learned. If you cannot
visit a cattle ranch or farm, view a video from a breed association, or research
the internet (with your parent’s permission) for information on beef cattle production. Tell about your findings.
(b) Sketch a plan of a feedlot to include its forage and grain storage facilities,
and loading chute for 30 or more fattening steers; or sketch a corral plan with
cutting and loading chutes for handling 50 or more beef cows and their calves
at one time.
(c) Make a sketch showing the principal wholesale and retail cuts of beef. Tell
about the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) dual grading system of beef.
Tell the basis of each grade in each system.
(d) Define the following terms: bull, steer, bullock, cow, heifer, freemartin,
heiferette, calf.

Dairying Option

differences in feeds typically used for dairy cows versus those fed to beef cows.
(b) Make a chart showing the components in cow’s milk or goat’s milk. Chart
the amount of each component.
(c) Explain the requirements for producing grade A milk. Tell how and why
milk is pasteurized.
(d) Tell about the kinds of equipment used for milking and the sanitation
standards that must be met on dairy farms.
(e) Define the following terms: bull, cow, steer, heifer, springer; buck, doe, kid.
