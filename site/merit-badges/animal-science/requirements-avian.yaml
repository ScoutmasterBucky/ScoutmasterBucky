            Badge Workbook when preparing for this requirement. Scouts will
            find it very helpful to have these notes organized and ready for

            this information during the class and fall behind the discussion
            trying to keep up with taking notes. Having this prepared for ahead

            pamphlet with this requirement in mind to familiarize themselves
            with differences in each of these areas for the different animals.
