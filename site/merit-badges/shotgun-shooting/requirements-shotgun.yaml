            Shooting score required—Hit at least 12 out of 25 targets (48
            percent) in two 25-target groups. The two groups need not be shot
            in consecutive order. A minimum of 50 shots must be fired. Shooting
            skill rules:

            * Targets may be thrown by a hand trap, manual mechanical trap, or
            on any trap or skeet field. Note: If using a hand trap or manual
            mechanical trap, the trap operator should be at least 5 feet to the
            right and 3 feet to the rear of the shooter. If throwing
            left-handed with a hand trap, the trap operator should be at least
            5 feet to the left and 3 feet to the rear of the shooter.
            * All targets should be thrown at a reasonable speed and in the
            same direction.
            * Targets should be generally thrown so as to climb in the air
            after leaving the trap.
            * Scores may be fired at any time, either in formal competition or
            in practice.
            * Any gauge shotgun not exceeding 12 gauge may be used.
            * Only commercially manufactured ammunition may be used. Reloads
            may not be used in BSA shooting sports programs.
            * Shooters must shoot in rounds of 25. Rounds need not be shot
            continuously or on the same day (the term “round” refers to a
            single series of 25 shots).
            * If using a trap field, shoot station 3 with traps set to throw
            straightaway targets.
            * If using a skeet field, shoot station 7 low house.
