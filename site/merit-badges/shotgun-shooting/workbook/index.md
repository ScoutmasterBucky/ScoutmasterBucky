If throwing left-handed with a hand trap this should be reversed.

* All targets should be thrown at a reasonable speed and in the same direction.

* Targets should be generally thrown so as to climb in the air after leaving the trap.

* Scores may be fired at any time, either in formal competition or in practice.

* Any gauge shotgun not exceeding 12 gauge may be used.

* Standard clay targets customarily used for trap and skeet are to be used.

* Any ammunition, either factory or hand loaded, may be used.
