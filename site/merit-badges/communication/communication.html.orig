      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-4799 mb-requirement-id-4800">
        (a) For one day, keep a log in which you describe your communication
        activities. Keep track of the time and different ways you spend
        communicating, such as talking person-to-person, listening to teachers,
        listening to the radio or podcasts, watching television, using social
        media, reading books and other print media, and using any electronic
        communication device. Discuss with your counselor what your log reveals
        about the importance of communication in your life. Think of ways to
        improve your communication skills.

      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-4799 mb-requirement-id-4801">
        (b) For three days, keep a journal of your listening experiences.
        Identify one example of each of the following, and discuss with your
        counselor when you have listened to:

          <li>Obtain information.</li>

      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-4799 mb-requirement-id-4802">
        (c) In a small-group setting, meet with other Scouts or with friends.
        Have them share personal stories about significant events in their lives
        that affected them in some way. Take note of how each Scout participates
        in the group discussion and how effectively each Scout communicates
        their story. Report what you have learned to your counselor about the
        differences you observed in effective communication.

        (face-to-face, by telephone, letter, email, text messages, social media,
        and so on). For each type of communication, discuss with your counselor
        an instance when that method might not be appropriate or effective.
