        <p><span class="C(red)">This requirement will NOT be covered in the class, however Scouts having completed this requirement prior to the class may bring their proof for review by the counselor.</span></p>
        <p>In order to receive credit, Scouts must bring a signed sheet (there is one available in the Scoutmaster Bucky Communications Merit Badge Workbook) by the Troop's Senior Patrol Leader verifying approval of the Scout to plan one of the specified Troop activities by the PLC. A signed note from the Scoutmaster is not usually acceptable to most counselors as the requirement needs to be approved by the PLC which headed by the Senior Patrol Leader, not the Scoutmaster. If the event has already happened there should also be some sort of confirmation showing that the Scouts served as Master of Ceremony for the event</p>
