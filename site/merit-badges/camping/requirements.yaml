            Scouts are encouraged to work on this requirement prior to
            the class. While time will be allotted in the class to covering the
            principles of Leave No Trace and the Outdoor Code, it will be
            structured more as a review of these principles rather than an
            introduction. Scouts will likely find it easier to prepare their
            personal plan ahead of time (or at least get a start on it). Time
            may be available during the class to refine or finish your personal
            plan, however those Scouts not coming to the class with preparation
            work in the way of at least having started formulating their
            personal plan will find it nearly impossible to finish this
            requirement on the day of the class.

            In order to receive credit for this requirement on the day of the
            class it is strongly recommended that Scouts use a Merit Badge
            Workbook to document their work and show sign-off by adults or
            leaders that they have completed components of this requirement.
            Utilizing the workbook will help aid the Counselor in assessing
            your completion of this requirement. Remember that just because YOU
            think you have completed a requirement, ultimately the Counselor
            determines whether you have completed a requirement to their
            satisfaction and interpretation of the requirement. The more
            prepared you are with proof of completion, the more likely you will
            be signed off when meeting with the Counselor.

            This requirement will most easily be completed by Scouts who have
            done Patrol/Troop camping in the past and have been a part of the
            planning. Whether the Scout has this camping experience or not, all

            Merit Badge Workbook to help with this requirement.

            Scouts wishing to receive credit for this requirement will also
            have to complete requirement 7b which can be done one of
            two ways. A Scoutmaster or other adult leader (with title shown)
            from the troop may provide a note and signature saying that this
            requirement has been fulfilled, or the Scout may bring their
            camping pack with them to class for review. Realizing that
            perishable items may not be right for this, Scouts should
            accommodate for this space when presenting their camping pack. BE
            PREPARED.

            There are many parts to this requirement component and the Scout will need some
            preparation work in order to complete this component. It is
            recommended to use the Scoutmaster Bucky Camping Merit Badge
            Workbook which has a camp menu planning section, to complete
            the first item of this component. If the Scout's troop has its own
            Camp Menu planning sheet, Scouts should consider using it for
            this part.

            Scouts may consider making notes as to how the menu might differ
            for a backpacking versus a float trip to aid them in their
            explanation they will provide as a part of the class with the
            Counselor.

            Scouts are encouraged to bring 12 copies of their single favorite
            camping recipe (this is so they can exchange and share these with
            the other Scouts in the class) all Scouts should then leave with a
            nice collection of camping recipe items (make sure you credit the
            appropriate recipe maker as well as your troop on the recipe card).
            Scouts can use the section in the Scoutmaster Bucky Camping Merit
            Badge Workbook to document their food list for this recipe. Make
            sure to specify in your food list how many Scouts this food list
            will accommodate for.

            Scouts can once again use the Scoutmaster Bucky Camping Merit
            Badge Workbook to assist with documenting their meal planning.
            Scouts should bring their completed 7 meal plans (two breakfast,
            three lunches, and two suppers) to class for review by the
            Counselor. A small portion of time will be allotted during the
            class for Scouts to work on this requirement so it is strongly
            recommended that any preparation work that can be done will help
            increase the success rate of completion for this part of the
            requirement.

            Finally, Scouts cannot overlook the last part of this requirement component and
            should make notes of their research and findings on food protection
            to use in the class discussion. Active participation is needed in
            this discussion in order to receive full credit for this component
            of the requirement.

                  Scouts will NOT cover this component in the class; however,
                  Scouts may choose to obtain a note from their Scoutmaster or
                  other adult leader if they have done this on a Troop or
                  Patrol camping adventure. The Counselor WILL review this
                  requirement component with the Scouts as a part of the class. Please note
                  that the note from your Scoutmaster or other adult leader
                  does not guarantee completion. Remember that completion of
                  any merit badge requirement is at the
                  satisfaction and discretion of the merit badge Counselor.
