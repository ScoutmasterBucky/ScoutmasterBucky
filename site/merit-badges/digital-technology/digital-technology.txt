Note to the Counselor
The Digital Technology merit badge was designed to show
the close relationship between humans and the technical
world surrounding us. The fleur-de-lis in the center represents
the Scout who, acting as the “brain” of a typical computing
device, interfaces with the digital technology world through
the means that those electronic devices can “under-
stand”—electrons, bits of data, and specialized path-
ways for information. As we increasingly use digital
technology in our everyday world, this relationship
extends from the Scout to the digital devices.
Eventually, the machine becomes an extension of
the Scout’s will, carrying out what the Scout directs it
to do. The challenge for the Scout and for every user of
digital technology is to understand this boundary and rela-
tionship, to not lose one’s own identity in the machine. We
humans must remember that machines are simply an extension
of—not a replacement for—the human mind.
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange,
or ASCII, is used to transmit information between computers.
To manage the alphabet, this binary system uses numbers 0 to
9 and special characters for 256 possible combinations with an
eight-digit binary number. Those numbers would be 00000000,
00000001, 00000010, 00000011, 00000100, up to 11111111. In deci-
mal it would be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, up to 255. That’s 256
combinations, including zero.
Where does that number come from? Computers at the
most fundamental level handle circuits that are like “on” and
“off” switches. In the decimal system, we typically use 10 sym-
bols—numerals 0 to 9—and every digit uses a factor of 10. The
binary system uses only two symbols—0 and 1—and a factor of
2. In the digital technology industry, these conditions are typi-
cally referred to as a binary number system with 1 for “on” and


DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY 3
0 for “off.” In decimal, the number 12 would be written as
12 = (1 X 10) + (2 X 1). In binary, it would be written as
1100 = (1 X 8) + (1 X 4) + (0 X 2) + (0 X 1).
This chart includes a “translation” of zero through 9, the
entire alphabet (capital and lowercase letters), and a few other
characters. See “Understanding Data and Files” for more infor-
mation on ASCII translation.
The original design for the Digital Technology merit badge contained a
special ASCII encoding for “BSA.” However, due to constraints in the
badge making process, this idea was abandoned. As a fun aside for
Scouts, see if they can figure out the message. For the letters “B,” “S,”
“A” in ASCII, here is the standard assignment:
B = 01000010 S = 01010011 A = 01000001
Starting from the tab in the top row to
the far left, notice a trace that stops at a circle,
which represents a zero. Going clockwise, the
next trace twists and radiates outward. The
next two end at circles. Then going down the
right side of the yellow tabs, combinations
of 1s and 0s are found. Eventually, if you go
around the entire badge, you get the 1s and
0s to spell out “BSA” in ASCII format.

6. Do THREE of the following. For each project you complete,
copy the files to a backup device and share the finished
projects with your counselor.
(a) Using a spreadsheet or database program, develop a food
budget for a patrol weekend campout OR create a troop roster
