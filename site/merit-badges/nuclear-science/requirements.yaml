            Describe the hazards of radiation to humans, the environment, and
            wildlife. Explain the difference between radiation exposure and
            contamination. In your explanation, discuss the nature and
            magnitude of radiation risks to humans from nuclear power, medical
            radiation (e.g., chest or dental X-ray), and background radiation
            including radon. Explain the ALARA principle and measures required
            by law to minimize these risks.
