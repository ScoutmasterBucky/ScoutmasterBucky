ARCHAEOLOGY

“Enhancing our youths’ competitive edge through merit badges”

Requirements

it differs or relates to other fields of study such as anthropology, geology, paleontology, and history. Explain how archaeology is different than artifact collecting or treasure hunting.
2. Describe each of the following steps of the archaeological
process: site location, development of background research
and a research design, site survey and fieldwork, artifact

located both within and outside the United States.
a. For EACH site you research, point it out on a map and
explain how it became known to archaeologists. Describe
some of the information about the past that has been
found at each site. Explain how the information gained
from the study of these sites answers questions that
archaeologists are asking and how the information may
be important to modern people. Compare the relative
ages of the sites you research.
b. Choose ONE of the sites you picked and give a short
presentation about your findings to a Cub Scout pack,
your Scout troop, your school class, or another group.
5. Do the following:

your counselor:
a. Visit a museum to observe how artifacts aid in
conveying history.
b. Present to your counselor a significant family artifact/
heirloom and discuss its history.
c. Make
	
a list of the trash your family throws out during
one week. Discuss with your counselor what archaeologists might learn about you and your family if they
found your trash a thousand years from now.
8. Research
	
a group of people who lived in your area more
than 100 years ago. Find out about their ways of life,
including housing, clothing, arts and crafts, tools, trade
and markets, rituals and religions, and diets, and their
relationships with other groups of people in the area.
Describe what you would expect to find at an archaeological
site where these people lived. Explain how these people
influenced your current community.
	
three career opportunities in archaeology. Pick one
9. Identify

10.	Do either A or B of the following:
a. With your parent’s and counselor’s permission, assist
a qualified archaeologist for at least eight hours with a
project being worked on. Projects may include surveying,
site monitoring, site stabilization, excavation, laboratory
analysis, use of digital archaeological technology, or public outreach. Describe your involvement in the project,
what you learned about archaeology, and the steps of
archaeological inquiry.
	Note: Visiting an archaeological site will require advance
planning. An archaeological site during study can be a
dangerous place. While there, you will need to closely follow the archaeologist’s directions and comply with all the
safety procedures. Be aware of the changing conditions at
the site.
b. With your counselor’s approval, take part in a simulated
archaeological project designed by a qualified archaeologist. The project must include the use of a simulated
archaeological site including artifacts and features for the
site. Using the steps of archaeological inquiry, analyze
the “artifacts and features” and document the spatial
relationships of the “artifacts and features” at the simulated site.
	Explain how the environment and time can affect the
interpretation of an artifact and the overall archaeological
site. Tell how you would share the results of your analysis with other researchers and the public.
	Note: To find out how to make a simulated archaeological
site, talk with a professional archaeologist, trained avocational archaeologist, museum school instructor, junior
high or high school science teacher, advisor from a local
archaeology society, or other qualified instructor.
 nder the supervision of a qualified archaeologist or
11. U
instructor, do ONE of the following:
a. Help
	
