            Adjust sights to center the group on the target`*` and fire five
            groups (five shots per group). According to the target used, each
            shot in the group must meet the following minimum score: (1) A-32
            targets—9; (2) A-17 or TQ-1 targets—7; (3) A-36 targets—5.

            `*` NOTE: It is not always practical to adjust the sights (i.e.,
            when using a borrowed fixed-sight rifle). For requirement 2(l), you
            may demonstrate your ability to use the shooting fundamentals by
            shooting five shot groups (five shots per group) in which all shots
            can be covered by or touch a quarter and then explain how to adjust
            the sights to zero the rifle used.
