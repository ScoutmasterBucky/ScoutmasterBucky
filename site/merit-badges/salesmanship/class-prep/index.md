        <p><span class="C(red)">The instructor / counselor for the class has stated that they will accept well-planned and prepared work for those Scouts who wish to prepare ahead of time.</span></p>
        <p>REQUIREMET 3: Scouts should try and prepare ahead of time for this requirement. While time will be allotted during the class to do this, Scouts will find it easiest to have done some planning and preparation ahead of time. Scouts may want to consider their popcorn, wreath sales, camp card, or other fundraising efforts as an example of salesmanship to consider when working on this requirement. Note that this requirement REQUIRES Scouts to "WRITE... a sales plan", so Scouts should use a notebook or the Scoutmaster Bucky Salesmanship Merit Badge workbook to complete their preparation prior to the class.</p>
        <p>REQUIREMET 4: Scouts should arrive at the class prepared to make a sales presentation for a product or service. Again, Scouts may want to draw on past experience from popcorn, wreath sales, camp card, or other fundraising efforts to prepare for this requirement. All Scouts attending will have an opportunity to make their sales presentation for consideration of being signed off on this requirement. Only Scouts who do a sales presentation to the satisfaction of the counselor during the class will be signed off on this requirement.</p>
