1. Do the following:
    (a) Explain the responsibilities of a salesperson and how a salesperson serves customers and helps stimulate the economy.
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should think about what a salesperson does, what they think their responsibilities are and how they serve customers, as well as how salesperson affects the economy. Scouts should consider formulating their thoughts and making notes as needed, in preparation for explanation during the class discussion for this requirement component.{{/note}}
    (b) Explain the differences between a business-to-business salesperson and a consumer salesperson.
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should review their merit badge pamphlet and come with an understanding for discussion in the class the differences asked for in this requirement component. It is highly recommended to utilize a Merit Badge Workbook to make notes of your findings. Scouts in attendance that have not reviewed their merit badge pamphlet for this topic and/or do not actively participate in the class discussion will find it difficult to complete this requirement.{{/note}}
2. Explain why it is important for a salesperson to do the following:
    (a) Research the market to be sure the product or service meets the needs of customers.
    (b) Learn all about the product or service to be sold.
    (c) If possible, visit the location where the product is built and learn how it is constructed. If a service is being sold, learn about the benefits of the service to the customer.
    (d) Follow up with customers after their purchase to confirm their satisfaction and discuss their concerns about the product or service.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts will find the use of the Scoutmaster Bucky Salesmanship Merit Badge pamphlet to be very helpful when preparing for this requirement and its components.

It is highly recommended that Scouts consider utilizing a merit badge workbook or notebook to make notes for reference when sharing their research and findings during the class.{{/note}}
3. Write and present a sales plan for a product or service and a sales territory assigned by your counselor.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}If possible, Scouts should try and prepare ahead of time for this requirement. While time will be allotted during the class to do this, Scouts will find it easiest to have done some planning and preparation ahead of time. Scouts may want to consider their popcorn, wreath sales, camp card, or other fundraising efforts as an example of salesmanship to consider when working on this requirement. Note that this requirement REQUIRES Scouts to "WRITE a sales plan", so Scouts should use a notebook or the Scoutmaster Bucky Salesmanship Merit Badge workbook to complete their preparation prior to the class for this requirement item.{{/note}}
4. Make a sales presentation of a product or service assigned by your counselor.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should arrive at the class prepared to make a sales presentation for a product or service. Again, Scouts may want to draw on past experience from popcorn, wreath sales, camp card, or other fundraising efforts to prepare for this requirement. All Scouts attending will have an opportunity to make their sales presentation for consideration of being signed off on this requirement. Only Scouts who do a sales presentation to the satisfaction of the counselor during the class will be signed off on this requirement.{{/note}}
5. Do ONE of the following and keep a record (cost sheet). Use the sales techniques you have learned, and share your experience with your counselor:
    (a) Help your unit raise funds through sales of merchandise or of tickets to a Scout event.
    (b) Sell your services such as lawn raking or mowing, pet watching, dog walking, show shoveling, and car washing to your neighbors. Follow up after the service has been completed and determine the customerâ€™s satisfaction.
    (c) Earn money through retail selling.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts who have participated in a unit fundraising effort will find completion of this requirement quite easy. Come prepared to share your experience with the counselor during the class for sign off on this requirement. If you have not participated in a Scout unit fundraising effort, consider other opportunities you may have participated in to complete this requirement and be prepared to share your experience during the class.  Remember to bring your documentations, as specified in this requirement, to the class for full consideration for completion of this requirement.{{/note}}

        (3) How is the product or service sold?
        (4) Include your own questions.
    (b) Interview a retail store owner and learn the following:

    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should consider working on this requirement prior to the class. While the counselor will help facilitate further insight to the components of this requirement, some Scouts may find it easier to come to the class with their required written statement completed, or at least started. While time will be allotted during the class to work on this, only Scouts who actively participate in the class discussion on this requirement and its components AND have a completed wirtten statement, will be considered for sign off on this requirement.{{/note}}
