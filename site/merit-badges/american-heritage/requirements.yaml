            Scouts should come to the class with notes on their research and
            understanding of this requirement. The "discuss" action will be a
            part of group discussion led by the counselor in which each Scout
            will be given an opportunity to share their findings for this
            component of the requirement. Note that there is a portion of this
            requirement that requires Scouts to "write" and Scouts will be
            asked to share their rewrite with the counselor.

            requirement to work on prior to the class and bring their completed
            work to the class ready to share for review. Bring proof of

            requirement components.

                  Scouts will need to carefully manage their time and resources
                  when working on this requirement. This is not a requirement
                  that can be done in an hour or two. Scouts should note that
                  while the Counselor will review the selected requirement by
                  each Scout during the class; ultimately it is up to each
                  Scout to select and prepare one of the three items prior to
                  the class. It cannot be emphasized enough that Scouts will
                  need to have proof of their work to share during the class if
                  they desire to be considered for sign off on this requirement
                  at the class.

                  This requirement is best completed by Scouts who allot
                  themselves plenty of time to complete and realize this is not
                  just a single afternoon project. Time will be provided within
                  the class for any Scouts interested in sharing their partial
                  or completed progress on this requirement.

            Scouts should identify career opportunities prior to attending the
            class and be prepared to discuss.  It is strongly recommended that
            Scouts bring any notes or supporting documents they may have to
            help show the counselor that they have prepared for discussion on
            this requirement
