Young collectors should also know
that the United States Postal Service
makes available a free guide called “The
Art of Stamp Collecting” (publication
225). Visit your local post office or down-
load it from http://about.usps.com/publi-
cations/pub225.pdf.
In addition, the U.S. Postal Service
has a special program for first day covers.
The USPS gives postal customers 30 days
to obtain a first day of issue postmark by
mail. Purchase the new stamp at a local
post office, affix the stamp to an enve-
lope addressed to yourself (or someone
else you designate), and send it in a
larger envelope to the USPS. (The
address appears at the bottom of each
stamp release; check with your local post
office.) Individual first day covers can be
ordered by writing to the USPS, Stamp
Fulfillment Services, P.O. Box 7247,
Philadelphia, PA 19101-7097; or call toll-
free 800-STAMP-24; or visit the USPS
website at https://store.usps.com/store.
