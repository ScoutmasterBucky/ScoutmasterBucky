b. Point out on a model airplane the forces that act on an
airplane in flight.
c. Explain how an airfoil generates lift, how the primary con-
trol surfaces (ailerons, elevators, and rudder) affect the

d. Demonstrate how the control surfaces of an airplane are
used for takeoff, straight climb, level turn, climbing turn,
descending turn, straight descent, and landing.

to make their own model, then organize a competition to
test the precision of flight and landing of the models.
4. Do ONE of the following:
a. Visit an airport. After the visit, report on how the facili-
ties are used, how runways are numbered, and how
runways are determined to be “active.”
b. Visit a Federal Aviation Administration facility—a con-
trol tower, terminal radar control facility, air route traffic
control center, or Flight Standards District Office. (Phone
directory listings are under U.S. Government Offices,
Transportation Department, Federal Aviation

and your impressions of the facility.
c. Visit an aviation museum or attend an air show. Report
