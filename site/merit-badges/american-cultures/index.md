{{#requirements}}
Choose THREE groups that have different racial, cultural, national, or ethnic backgrounds, one of which comes from your own background. Use these groups to meet requirements 1, 2, and 3.
1. Do TWO of the following, choosing a different group for each:
    (a) Go to a festival, celebration, or other event identified with one of the groups. Report on what you see and learn.
    (b) Go to a place of worship, school, or other institution identified with one of the groups. Report on what you see and learn.
    (c) Talk with a person from one of the groups about the heritage and traditions of the group. Report on what you learn.
    (d) Learn a song, dance, poem, or story that is traditional to one group, and teach it to a group of your friends.
    (e) Go to a library or museum to see a program or exhibit featuring one group's traditions. Report on what you see and learn.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts will find that all of these options in this requirement require some sort of reporting or explanation after completing the action specified. Scouts will have an opportunity to share their findings and experiences with the Counselor and other Scouts. Any supporting material (ticket stubs, photos, souvenirs, pamphlets, etc.) from the event, visit, locale, etc that Scouts can bring to show and share as a part of their reporting would be of great benefit. While Scouts are not required to "report" in writing, it is strongly suggested to at least use something like the Scoutmaster Bucky American Cultures Merit Badge Workbook to help manage and organize notes while completing his requirement.{{/note}}
2. Imagine that one of the groups had always lived alone in a city or country to which no other groups ever came. Tell what you think the city or country might be like today. Now tell what you think it might be like if the three groups you chose lived there at the same time.
3. Tell about some differences between the religions and social customs of the three groups. Tell about some ideas or ways of doing things that are similar in the three groups.
4. Tell about a contribution made to our country by three different people, each from a different racial, ethnic, or religious background.
5. Give a talk to your Scout unit or class at school on how people from different groups have gotten along together. Lead a discussion on what can be done to help various groups understand one another better.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}While not required, it is strongly recommended that prior to making any presentation, you should review the contents of your presentation with your Counselor. Scouts wishing to make their presentation during the class will have the opportunity to do so, however it should be noted that there will be NO time allotted for preparing for this during the class. Scouts choosing this option will need to come fully prepared and ready to present. Remember it is at the discretion of the Counselor as to whether the requirement has been satisfactorily completed. All Scouts will be given an opportunity to lead the discussion in order to complete this requirement.{{/note}}
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}If this requirement was completed prior to the class, you will need to provide proof of completion (i.e. a note from your Scout Leader or Teacher).  Just saying so is not enough to guarantee completion of this requirement.  Bring proof, or be prepared to present.{{/note}}
