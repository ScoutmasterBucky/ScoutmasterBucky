        Scouts will find that all of these options in this requirement
        require some sort of reporting or explanation after completing the
        action specified. Scouts will have an opportunity to share their
        findings and experiences with the Counselor and other Scouts. Any
        supporting material (ticket stubs, photos, souvenirs, pamphlets,
        etc.) from the event, visit, locale, etc that Scouts can bring to
        show and share as a part of their reporting would be of great
        benefit. While Scouts are not required to "report" in writing, it
        is strongly suggested to at least use something like the
        Scoutmaster Bucky American Cultures Merit Badge Workbook to help
        manage and organize notes while completing his requirement.

    Imagine that one of the groups had always lived alone in a city or
    country to which no other groups ever came. Tell what you think the city
    or country might be like today. Now tell what you think it might be like
    if the three groups you chose lived there at the same time.

        It is recommended that Scouts consider utilizing a workbook or
        notebook to make notes for reference during the class discussion on
        this requirement. This process will make it easier for Scouts to
        actively participate in class discussion and ensure completion of
        this requirement.

        While not required, it is strongly recommended that prior to making
        any presentation, you should review the contents of your
        presentation with your Counselor. Scouts wishing to make their
        presentation during the class will have the opportunity to do so,
        however it should be noted that there will be NO time allotted for
        preparing for this during the class. Scouts choosing this option
        will need to come fully prepared and ready to present. Remember it
        is at the discretion of the Counselor as to whether the requirement
        has been satisfactorily completed. All Scouts will be given an
        opportunity to lead the discussion in order to complete this
        requirement.

        If this requirement was completed prior to the class, you will need
        to provide proof of completion (i.e. a note from your Scout Leader
        or Teacher).  Just saying so is not enough to guarantee completion
        of this requirement.  Bring proof, or be prepared to present.
