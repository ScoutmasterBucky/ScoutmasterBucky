Surveying
1. Show that you know first aid for the types of injuries that could occur while
surveying, including cuts, scratches, snakebite, insect stings, tick bites, heat
and cold reactions, and dehydration. Explain to your counselor why a
surveyor should be able to identify the poisonous plants and poisonous
animals that are found in your area.
2. Do the following:
(a) Set an instrument over one of the corners of a five-sided lot laid out by
your counselor and sighting one of the other corners for reference and, using
radial measurement methods, record the angle turned and the distance
measured to each of the remaining corners, as directed by your counselor.
Record the angle and distance to five topographic features (trees, shrubs, rocks,
etc.) near your work area.
(b) Measure to three of the same points with GPS measurement and compare
the distances between the points measured.
3. From the field notes gathered for requirement 2, and using a protractor and
scale, plot the points you measured and draw to scale a map of your survey
which includes a north arrow, scale bar, title, date and a diagram of the lot
you measured. Submit a neatly drawn copy.
4. Use one of the corner markers from requirement 2 as a benchmark with an
assumed elevation of 100 feet. Using a level and rod, collect and record
measurements, and determine the elevation of the other four corner markers.
5. Get a copy of the deed to a piece of property approved by your counselor,
from the local courthouse or title agency. Discuss with your counselor the
different parts of the deed and their importance.
6. Discuss emerging surveying technology such as drones and laser scanning and
the strengths and weaknesses of each.
7. Tell what GPS is; discuss with your counselor the importance of GPS and how
it is changing the field of surveying.
8. Discuss the importance of surveying with a licensed surveyor. Also discuss
the various types of surveying and mapping, and applications of surveying
technology to other fields. Discuss career opportunities in surveying and
related fields. Discuss the qualifications and preparation for such a career.
