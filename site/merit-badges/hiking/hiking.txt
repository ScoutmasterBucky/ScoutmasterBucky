and respond to these hazards.

while hiking, including hypothermia, frostbite, dehydration, heat exhaustion,
heatstroke, sunburn, hyperventilation, altitude sickness, sprained ankle, blisters, insect stings, tick bites, and snakebite.
2. Explain and, where possible, show the points of good hiking practices including
proper outdoor ethics, hiking safety in the daytime and at night, courtesy to others, choice of footwear, and proper care of feet and footwear.

during each hike, but not for an extended period (example: overnight). Prepare
a written hike plan before each hike and share it with your Scoutmaster or a
designee. Include map routes, a clothing and equipment list, and a list of items
for a trail lunch.*
