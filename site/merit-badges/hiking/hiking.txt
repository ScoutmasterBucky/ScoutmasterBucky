BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA
MERIT BADGE SERIES
“Enhancing our youths’ competitive edge through merit badges”


1. Do the following:
(a)Explain to your counselor the most likely hazards you may encounter
while hiking, and what you should do to anticipate, help prevent, mitigate,
and respond to these hazards.
(b)Show that you know first aid for injuries or illnesses that could occur
while hiking, including hypothermia, frostbite, dehydration, heat exhaustion,
heatstroke, sunburn, hyperventilation, altitude sickness, sprained ankle,
blisters, insect stings, tick bites, and snakebite.
2. Do the following:
(a) Explain and, where possible, show the points of good hiking practices
including proper outdoor ethics, hiking safety in the daytime and at night,
courtesy to others, choice of footwear, and proper care of feet and footwear.
(b) Read aloud or recite the Leave No Trace guidelines, and discuss why each is
important while hiking.
(c) Read aloud or recite the Outdoor Code, and give examples of how to follow it
on a hike.
3. Explain how hiking is an aerobic activity. Develop a plan for conditioning yourself
for 10-mile hikes, and describe how you will increase your fitness for longer hikes.
4. Take four 10-mile hikes and one 20-mile hike, each on a different day, and each of
continuous miles. Prepare a written hike plan before each hike and share it with
your merit badge counselor or a designee for approval before starting the hike.
Include map routes, a clothing and equipment list, and a list of items for a trail
lunch. You may stop for as many short rest periods as needed, as well as one
meal, during each hike, but not for an extended period such as overnight.*
5. After each of the hikes (or during each hike if on one continuous “trek”) in
requirement 4, write a short report on your hike. For each hike, give the date and
description (or map) of the route covered, the weather, any interesting things you
saw, and any challenges you had and how you overcame them. It may include
something you learned about yourself, about the outdoors, or about others you
were hiking with. Share this with your merit badge counselor.*
