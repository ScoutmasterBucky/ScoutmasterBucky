1. Understand how coins are made, and where the active U.S. Mint facilities are located.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}This requirement will be covered in the class however Scouts should make sure they have read the merit badge pamphlet prior to the class so that they can actively participate in the class presentation and discussions for completing this requirement. Active participation in the class will be one of the measures the counselor uses to determine whether the Scout has met the requirement which is to understand the elements of this requirement.{{/note}}

    (a) Obverse
    (b) Reverse
    (c) Reeding
    (d) Clad
    (e) Type set
    (f) Date set
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should review this requirement and its terms and be prepared to explain. It is strongly recommended that Scouts bring any notes or supporting documents they may have to help show the counselor that they have prepared for explanation of these items. These terms will be discussed in the class.{{/note}}
3. Explain the grading terms Uncirculated, Extremely Fine, Very Fine, Fine, Very Good, Good, and Poor. Show five different grade examples of the same coin type. Explain the term *proof* and why it is not a grade. Tell what encapsulated coins are.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}This requirement will be worked on in class, however Scouts should review this requirement and its components and be prepared to explain what they have learned both prior to the class and in the class. Reading the merit badge pamphlet ahead of time will prove to be very helpful preparation for this requirement..{{/note}}
4. Know three different ways to store a collection, and describe the benefits, drawbacks, and expense of each method. Pick one to use when completing requirements.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts will need to research this ahead of time as they will need to apply their findings to some of the following requirements.{{/note}}
5. Do ONE of the following:
    (a) Demonstrate to your counselor that you know how to use two U.S. or world coin reference catalogs.
    (b) Read a numismatic magazine or newspaper and tell your counselor about what you learned.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}This requirement will be completed as a part of the class. Scouts are encouraged to bring any reference catalogs or magazine/newspapers they may have related to coin collecting for use during the class.{{/note}}
6. Describe the 1999-2008 50 State Quarters program or the America the Beautiful Quarters program. Collect and show your counselor five different quarters from circulation you have acquired from one of these programs.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts will find this requirement enjoyable and easy to do. While not required, after you have collected the five different State Quarters to fulfill the requirement, see how many MORE State Quarters you can gather up from everyday circulating coins. Scouts will need to bring at least 5 State Quarters in order to be considered for completion of this requirement at the class.{{/note}}
7. Collect from circulation a set of current U.S. coins. Include one coin of each denomination (cent, nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar, dollar). For each coin, locate the mint marks, if any, and the designer's initials, if any.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts must at a minimum collect from circulation a set of current U.S. coins and bring them with to the class. The Scoutmaster Bucky Coin Collecting Merit Badge Workbook can serve as a great organizer / checklist for gathering these coins. The rest of this requirement will be covered in the class.{{/note}}
8. Do the following:
    (a) Identify the people depicted on the following denominations of current U.S. paper money: $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100.

    (c) Describe the role the Federal Reserve System plays in the distribution of currency.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts are encouraged to try and answer these requirements prior to coming to the class.

    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts wishing to do one of these requirements ahead of time are encouraged to do so. This requirement MAY or MAY NOT be done in the class. IF there is time at the end of the class, Scouts will have an opportunity to do Requirement 10D, however no guarantee is made that there will be enough time to complete this requirement in the class. Scouts having done preparation work for one of these options WILL have an opportunity to present their work and more than likely be able to complete this requirement as well as the merit badge (ultimately sign off on ANY requirement is at the sole discretion of the merit badge counselor).{{/note}}
