            Scouts should come to the class with a copy of the article they
            selected for Requirement 1a.  If it is from the internet the URL
            should be included as reference to where it was found.  If it is
            from a magazine or newspaper the cover page or at least the
            publication date should be noted somewhere along with the article.

            Only Scouts that successfully are prepared and complete
            requirements 2 through 8 during the class will have an opportunity
            of finishing this requirement, as component 1b of this requirement

            Again, this requirement and its components will be difficult to

            Note that this requirement has many parts that must be remembered
            when working on this requirement.  Not only must Scouts prepare pie
            charts they must also be prepared to explain and tell of their
            findings and analysis. The counselor will facilitate discussion on
            this requirement during the class, but Scouts not doing preparation
            work will find that the discussion on this requirement will merely
            be an opportunity for them to get the obvious clarification of the
            counselor's expectations for successful completion of this
            requirement at a later date.
