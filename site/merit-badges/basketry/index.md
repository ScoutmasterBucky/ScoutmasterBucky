{{#note type="inPerson"}}Scoutmaster Bucky Basketry Merit Badge classes will provide the basketry kits as part of the class.{{/note}}
1. Do the following:
    (a) Explain to your counselor the hazards you are most likely to encounter while using basketry tools and materials, and what you should do to anticipate, help prevent, mitigate, and respond to these hazards.
    (b) Discuss the prevention of and first-aid treatment for injuries, including cuts, scratches, and scrapes, that could occur while working with basketry tools and materials.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts will engage in discussion on their findings during the class. Scouts should review the Basketry Merit Badge pamphlet to have a better understanding of hazards and first aid components for this requirement. The counselor / instructor will facilitate discussion on this requirement during the class. It should be noted that only Scouts that actively, positively, and successfully participate in the discussion will be signed off on this requirement. Preparation is a must.{{/note}}
2. Do the following:
    (a) Show your counselor that you are able to identify each of the following types of baskets: plaited, coiled, ribbed, and wicker.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should look up and learn each of these types of baskets and be prepared to share their understanding of each in class discussion. All terms can be found in the Merit Badge Pamphlet. Some Scouts may find it easier to write down their findings in their Merit Badge Workbook for quicker and easier reference for use during the class.{{/note}}
    (b) Describe three different types of weaves to your counselor.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts will find most, if not all, information needed to complete this requirement in the merit badge pamphlet. Scouts are encouraged to use a Merit Badge Workbook to track their findings and to share these with their merit badge counselor / instructor during the appropriate time during the class to insure the counselor that Scouts have prepared and completed this requirement to their satisfaction.{{/note}}
3. Plan and weave each of the following projects:
    (a) a square basket
    (b) a round basket
    (c) a campstool seat
    {{#note type="inPerson"}}Scouts will be provided basketry kits for each of the components in requirement 3 and will spend the majority of class time working on each. Once Scouts have completed each of these components the counselor / instructor will review their work and sign off appropriately. These weaving projects take some time and Scouts should not expect to complete all three projects within the time frame of the class. Some Scouts have been able to but is should not be expected.{{/note}}
    {{#note type="online"}}Scouts will need to procure the three appropriate basketry kits outlined in requirement 3. Scouts will have the opportunity to share their completed basketry work or get guidance on these from the counselor / instructor as a part of this class. Once Scouts have completed each of these components the counselor / instructor will review their work and sign off appropriately. These weaving projects take some time and Scouts should not expect to complete all three projects within the time frame of the class. Follow up opportunities will be provided during the class. Be Preapred!{{/note}}
