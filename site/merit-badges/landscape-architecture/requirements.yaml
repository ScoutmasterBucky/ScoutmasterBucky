- requirement: 3

    Identify five shrubs, five trees, and one ground cover, being sure that
    you select examples of different shapes, sizes, and textures. With the
    help of your counselor or a local nursery, choose plants that will grow
    in your area. Bring pictures of the different planting materials or, if
    possible, examples of their branches, leaves, or flowers to a group such
    as your troop or class at school.  Be prepared to tell how you might use
    each in the design of a landscape and the maintenance that would follow.

        Using a measuring tape, measure and draw the main site entry and
        its nearby area. Define the scale of your drawing. Be sure to
        include the driveway and sidewalk or path that leads to the
        buildingâ€™s main entry. Indicate any sidewalks, structures, trees
        and plants, lights, drains, utilities, or other site furnishings
        within the study area. Make two copies of this plan and save the
        original, then do 4b and 4c using the copies.
    - requirement: b

        On one copy of your site plan, use directional arrows to indicate
        where the water drains across the site, where ditches occur, and
        where water stands for a longer period of time.

        Decide how you can make the place safer and more comfortable for
        those using it. Redesign the area on another copy of the plan. You
        may want to include new walks, covered waiting areas, benches,
        space-defining plantings of trees and shrubs, and drainage
        structures.
