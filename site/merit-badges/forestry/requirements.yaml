            a. The characteristics of leaf, twig, cone, or fruiting bodies

            b. The habitat in which these trees, shrubs, or vines are found

            c. The important ways each tree, shrub, or vine is used by humans
            or wildlife and whether the species is native or was introduced to
            the area. If it is not native, explain whether it is considered
            invasive or potentially invasive.
