        {{#note type="inPerson"}}The merit badge counselor will help facilitate completing this requirement in the class, however, Scouts should review the merit badge pamphlet prior to the class to have a general understanding of each of the components of this requirement. While not required, but highly encouraged, Scouts are encouraged to explore doing work ahead of time and bringing that work to share as a part of the class.{{/note}}
        {{#note type="online"}}The merit badge counselor will review any work the Scouts have done in preparing for this requirement, however it must be noted that the online format does not accommodate completion of this requirement during the class.

    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should review the Textile Merit Badge Pamphlet or other reliable srouces and attend with an understanding for discussion, the terms identified in this requirement.
