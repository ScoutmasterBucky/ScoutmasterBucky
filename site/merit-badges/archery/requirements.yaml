            Most of the requirements for Option B will be done during the
            class, however Scouts should review Option B requirements 5a, 5b,
            5c, and 5d prior to the class and come with a knowledge to expedite
            discussion on these items. Option B requirement 5e will be covered
            in the class and Option B requirement 5f2 will be utilized as the
            measure of shooting proficiency that must be attained by Scouts
            when shooting. Please note that this is a skill-based requirement
            and only Scouts that are able to meet the standards will have the
            opportunity of completing this component of the requirement.
