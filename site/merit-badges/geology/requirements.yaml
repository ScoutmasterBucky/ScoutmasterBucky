                        of its class (if it is a rock) or list its identifying
                        physical properties (if it is a mineral).

            Visit a science museum or the geology department of a local
            university that has fossils on display. With your parent’s and
            counselor’s approval, before you go, make an appointment with a
            curator or guide who can show you how the fossils are preserved and
            prepared for display.

            Visit a structure in your area that was built using fossiliferous
            rocks. Determine what kind of rock was used and tell your counselor
            the kinds of fossil evidence you found there.

            Prepare a display or presentation on your state fossil. Include an
            image of the fossil, the age of the fossil, and its classification.
            You may use maps, books, articles from periodicals, and research
            found on the internet (with your parent’s permission). Share the
            display with your counselor or a small group (such as your class at
            school). If your state does not have a state fossil, you may select
            a state fossil from a neighboring state.
