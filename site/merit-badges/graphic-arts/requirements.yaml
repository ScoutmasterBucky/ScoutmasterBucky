            Scouts will find the use of the merit badge pamphlet to be
            extremely helpful in preparing for the components of this
            requirement.  It is strongly recommended that Scouts utilize a
            merit badge workbook to help organize their notes and findings for
            reference during class discussion. Active participation in the
            class discussion is necessary for consideration in being signed off
            on this requirement.  Scouts should also remember to bring their
            three samples or diagrams to aide them in their discussion and in
            order to successfully complete the entire requirement.  Scouts not
            attending with samples or diagrams may find it difficult to
            complete this requirement at the class, so to ensure the highest
            probability of getting signed off on this requirement, remember to
            bring your samples or diagrams.

            While the merit badge counselor will help facilitate some
            educational components on this requirement, Scouts should review
            the merit badge pamphlet for a better understanding coming into the
            class.  Scouts will be expected to be able to clearly and
            accurately share with the counselor through explanation their
            understanding of this requirement during the class based on their
            preparation work and what the counselor shares and educates them
            with.

            This requirement is best done prior to the class, or at least the
            design part of the requirement.  The emphasis of this requirement
            is to understand the process of creating such a design.  It has
            been found that Scouts coming to the class with their design
            already conceptualized and designed have a far better chance of
            completing this requirement then Scouts who attend not having even
            started on this requirement.  While time will be allotted in the
            class for some design work, it cannot be guaranteed that Scouts not
            coming to class with their deign in-hand will fully complete this
            requirement. It is best to have this one ready prior to the class
            to insure the highest probability for completion.
