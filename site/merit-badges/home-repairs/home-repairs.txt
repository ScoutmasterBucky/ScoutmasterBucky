BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA
MERIT BADGE SERIES

HOME REPAIRS

“Enhancing our youths’ competitive edge through merit badges”

Note to the Counselor
Nothing encourages pride in one’s surroundings more than
being able to improve them through one’s own initiative
and resources.
That is why the Home Repairs merit badge can be
so important to the development of a young person.
Once Scouts learn basic home repair skills and
apply them to their own environment, they will
have a lifetime resource: the ability to learn
new skills.
Home repair, however, can be intimidating at first, especially if the Scout lacks a role
model for such activities. If p
­ ossible, provide
one-on-one or group activities that will get the
Scout off to a good start.
Encourage each Scout to acquire a good set
of basic tools, and help Scouts learn to keep their
tools in one place and in good repair. That way, they will
“be prepared” to handle repairs as needed.
There is no time limit for completing the requirements.
Major tasks, such as waterproofing a basement, may be
completed in tandem with another Scout working on
the requirement, and/or with the assistance of an adult.
The majority of the work, however, should be performed
by the Scouts earning the badge.
This book provides a good overview of home-repair
projects, but it is by no means a complete reference. For some
requirements, space does not permit going into construction
details or listing all possible repair variations. Therefore, any
new construction or installation or completion of a similar
project (for example, any toilet repair or adjustment) qualifies
as achieving the requirement so long as the Scout understands
and demonstrates the basic concepts involved.
