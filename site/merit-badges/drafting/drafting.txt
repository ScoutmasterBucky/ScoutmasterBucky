Requirements
1. Format TWO sheets of drawing paper with proper
borders and title blocks—one for your manual project
(see requirement 2) and one for your lettering project
(see requirement 5).
a. Make a rough sketch for each of your project drawings
to determine the correct size of paper to format.
b. Using either single-stroke vertical or slant Gothic lettering,
fill in all important information in the title block sections
of the formatted paper.
2. Using the formatted sheet of paper you prepared for your
manual project, produce a pencil drawing as it would be
used for manufacturing. Fill in all title block information.
The manual drawing may be any one of the following
drawing types:
a. Architectural: Make a scale drawing of an architectural
project. The architectural drawing may be a floor plan;
electrical, plumbing, or mechanical service plan; elevation
plan; or landscaping plan. Use an architect’s scale and
show dimensions to communicate the actual size of
features. Include any important sectional drawings, notes,
and considerations necessary for construction.
b. Mechanical: Make a scale drawing of some mechanical
device or interesting object. The mechanical drawing
may be of the orthographic or isometric style. Use an
engineer’s scale and show dimensions to communicate
the actual size of features. Include any important sectional
drawings, notes, and manufacturing considerations.

DRAFTING 3
c. Electrical: Draw a simple schematic of a radio or
electronic circuit. Properly print a bill of materials
including all of the major electrical components
used in the circuit. Use standard drawing symbols
to represent the electronic components.
3. Produce a computer-aided design (CAD) drawing as it
would be used in manufacturing. Fill in all title block
information. The CAD drawing may be any one of the
following drawing types:
a. Architectural: Make a scale drawing of an architectural
project. The architectural drawing may be a floor plan;
electrical, plumbing, or mechanical service plan; elevation
plan; or landscaping plan. Use an architect’s scale and
show dimensions to communicate the actual size of
features. Include any important sectional drawings,
notes, and considerations necessary for construction.
b. Mechanical: Make a scale drawing of some mechanical
device or interesting object. The mechanical drawing may
be of the orthographic or isometric style. Use an engineer’s
scale and show dimensions to communicate the actual size
of features. Include any important sectional drawings, notes,
and manufacturing considerations.
c. Electrical: Draw a simple schematic of a radio or electronic
circuit. Properly print a bill of materials including all of
the major electrical components used in the circuit.
Use standard drawing symbols to represent the
electronic components.
4. Discuss with your counselor how fulfilling requirements
2 and 3 differed from each other. Tell about the benefits
derived from using CAD for requirement 3. Include in your
discussion the software you used as well as other software
options that are available.

Acknowledgments
The Boy Scouts of America gives
special thanks to avid Scouter David
Oakley, Lincoln Park, Michigan, for his
support, subject expertise, and patience
with this revision of the Drafting merit
badge pamphlet. Mr. Oakley remained
a constant and invaluable resource
throughout this lengthy project.
We greatly appreciate Ford Motor
Company for allowing us to have a
photo shoot at its facility in Dearborn,
Michigan. Thanks also to Adam Wendl
and David Wendl of Troop 1052,
Dearborn, Michigan, for their assis-
tance with photography. We appreciate
Jim Hamblin, brake engineer, Ford
Motor Company, for his assistance with
the isometric section. Thanks to Roland
Kuhleman, instructor, architecture/engi-
neering graphics and computer applica-
tions, Haltom (Texas) High School,

4 DRAFTING
5. Using single-stroke slant or vertical Gothic lettering (without
the aid of a template or lettering guide), write a brief expla-
nation of what you consider to be the most important
benefit in using CAD in a particular industry (aerospace,
electronics, manufacturing, architectural, or other). Use
the experience gained in fulfilling requirements 2, 3, and
4 to support your opinion. Use the formatted sheet of paper
you prepared in requirement 1 for your lettering project.
6. Do ONE of the following (a or b):
a. Visit a facility or industry workplace where drafting is
part of the business. Ask to see an example of the work
that is done there, the different drafting facilities, and
the tools used.
(1) Find out how much of the drafting done there is
manual and how much is done using CAD. If CAD
is used, find out what software is used and how and
why it was chosen.
(2) Ask about the drafting services provided. Ask who
uses the designs produced in the drafting area and
how those designs are used. Discuss how the profes-
sionals who perform drafting cooperate with other
individuals in the drafting area and other areas of
the business.
(3) Ask how important the role of drafting is to producing
the end product or service that this business supplies.
Find out how drafting contributes to the company’s
end product or service.
b. Using resources you find on your own such as at the
library and on the Internet (with your parent’s permission),
learn more about the drafting trade and discuss the
following with your counselor.
(1) The drafting tools used in the past—why and how
they were used. Explain which tools are still used
today and how their use has changed with the advent
of new tools. Discuss which tools are being made
obsolete by newer tools in the industry.

DRAFTING 5
(2) Tell what media types were used in the past and how
drawings were used, stored, and reproduced. Tell how
the advent of CAD has changed the media used, and
discuss how these changes affect the storage or repro-
duction of drawings.
(3) Discuss whether the types of media have changed
such that there are new uses for the drawings, or
other outputs, produced by designers. Briefly discuss
how new media types are used in the industry today.
7. Find out about three career opportunities in drafting. Pick
one and find out the education, training, and experience
required for this profession. Discuss this with your coun-
selor, and explain why this profession might interest you.
