1. Using resources available to you, learn about working people and work-related concerns. List and briefly describe or give examples of at least EIGHT concerns of American workers. These may include, but are not limited to, working conditions, workplace safety, hours, wages, seniority, job security, equal-opportunity employment and discrimination, guest workers, automation and technologies that replace workers, unemployment, layoffs, outsourcing, and employee benefits such as health care, child care, profit sharing, continuing education, and retirement benefits.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}It is strongly recommended that Scouts use the Scoutmaster Bucky American Labor Merit Badge Workbook to assist in readying themselves for the class. Having written notes for all of the items required will prove to be beneficial when sharing their brief descriptions with the counselor and class.

    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should be prepared to share their findings with the class and should be prepared with this requirement prior to the class. 1/2 of this requirement is preparation and research, the other 1/2 which will be facilitated in the class is the presentation. Scouts cannot complete this requirement by only doing one or the other, both parts must be done.

Preparation is a MUST for this requirement along with active class participation.{{/note}}
