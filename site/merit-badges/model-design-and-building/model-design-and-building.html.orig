    <ul class="mb-requirement-children-list">
      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-8986 mb-requirement-id-8987">
        (a) Make an architectural model. Build a model of a house to a scale of
        1⁄4" = 1'0" (50:1 metric). Discuss with your counselor the materials you
        intend to use, the amount of detail required, outside treatment (finish,
        shrubbery, walks, etc.), and color selections. After completing the
        model, present it to your counselor for approval.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-8986 mb-requirement-id-8988">
        (b) Build a structural model. Construct a model showing corner
        construction of a wood-frame building to a scale of 11⁄2" = 1'0" (1:8
        scale). All structures shown must be to scale. Cardboard or flat sheet
        wood stock may be used for sheeting or flooring on the model. Review
        with your counselor the problems you encountered in gathering the
        materials and supporting the structure. Be able to name the parts of the
        floor and wall frames, such as intermediate girder, joist, bridging,
        subfloor, sill, sole plate, stud, and rafter.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-8986 mb-requirement-id-8989">
        (c) Make a process model. Build a model showing the plumbing system in
        your house. Show hot and cold-water supply, all waste returns, and
        venting to a scale of 3 ⁄4" = 1'0" (15:1 metric). Talk to your counselor
        about how to begin this model, and present the scale and the materials
        you will use. After completion, present the model to your counselor, and
        be prepared to discuss any problems you had building this model.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-8986 mb-requirement-id-8990">
        (d) Complete a mechanical model. Build a model of a mechanical device
        that uses at least two of the six simple machines. After completing the
        model, present it to your counselor. Be prepared to discuss materials
        used, the machine's function, and any particular difficulty you might
        have encountered.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-requirement-child mb-parent-8986 mb-requirement-id-8991">
        (e) Make an industrial model. Build a model of an actual
        passenger-carrying vehicle to a scale of 1" = 1'0" or 1 ⁄2" = 1'0" (10:1
        or 25:1 metric). Take the dimensions of the vehicle and record the
        important dimensions. Draw the top, front, rear, and sides of the
        vehicle to scale. From your plans, build a model of the vehicle and
        finish it in a craftsmanlike manner. Discuss with your counselor the
        most difficult part of completing the model.
