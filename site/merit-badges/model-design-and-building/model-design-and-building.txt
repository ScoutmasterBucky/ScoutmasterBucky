Model Design and Building
1. Study and understand the requirements for personal safety when using such
modelmaker hand tools as knives, handsaws, vises, files, hammers, screwdrivers, hand drills and drill bits, pliers, and portable power tools, and when
to use proper protective equipment such as goggles when grinding or drilling.
Know what precautions to take when using flammable or hazardous products
such as glue, epoxy, paint, and thinners. Discuss these with your counselor
before you begin your modelmaking project and tell why they are important.
2. Explain the uses for each of the following types of models: architectural,
structural, process, mechanical, and industrial. Do research into the different
types of materials that could be used in making these models.
3. With your counselor‚Äôs advice, select a subject from requirement 4 for your
model project. Kits may not be used. Prepare the necessary plans to the
proper scale. This model should be your own original work. Tell your counselor why you selected this project
4. Do ONE of the following:
(a) Make an architectural model. Build a model of a house to a scale of
1
‚ÅÑ4" = 1'0" (1:50 scale). After completing the model, present it to your counselor for approval. Review with your counselor the materials you used and the
details of your model.
(b) Build a structural model. Construct a model showing corner construction
of a wood-frame building to a scale of 11‚ÅÑ2" = 1'0" (1:8 scale). All structures
shown must be to scale. Cardboard or flat sheet wood stock may be used for
sheeting or flooring on the model. Review with your counselor the problems
you encountered in gathering the materials and supporting the structure.
Be able to name the parts of the floor and wall frames, such as intermediate
girder, joist, bridging, subfloor, sill, sole plate, stud, and rafter.
(c) Make a process model. Build a model showing the plumbing system in
your house. Show hot and cold water supply, all waste returns, and venting to
a scale of 3‚ÅÑ4" = 1'0" (1:15 scale). After completion, present the model to your
counselor. Discuss the scale, the materials used, and any problems you
encountered in building the model.
(d) Complete a mechanical model. Build a model of a mechanical device that
uses at least two of the six simple machines. After completing the model,
present it to your counselor. Be prepared to discuss materials used, the
machine‚Äôs function, and any particular difficulty you might have encountered.

(e) Make an industrial model. Build a model of an actual passenger-carrying
vehicle to a scale of 1" = 1'0" or 1‚ÅÑ2" = 1'0" (1:10 or 1:25 scale). Take the
dimensions of the vehicle and record the important dimensions. Draw the top,
front, rear, and sides of the vehicle to scale. From your plans, build a model of
the vehicle. Discuss with your counselor the most difficult part of completing
the model.
5. Build a special-effects model of a fantasy spacecraft or a hand-held prop that
might appear in a Hollywood science-fiction movie. Determine an appropriate
scale for your design. Include a cockpit or control area, living space, storage
unit, engineering spaces, and propulsion systems. As you plan and build your
model, do the following:
(a) Study existing designs of vehicles and hand-held devices.
(b) Arrange and assemble the parts.
(c) Sketch your completed model.
(d) Discuss your design, scale, and materials choices with your counselor.
Describe how you engineered your model and discuss any difficulties you
encountered and what you learned.
6. List at least six occupations in which modelmaking is used and discuss with
your counselor some career opportunities in this field.
