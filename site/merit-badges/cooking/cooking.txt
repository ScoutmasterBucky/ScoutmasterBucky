COOKING
BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA
MERIT BADGE SERIES
“Enhancing our youths’ competitive edge through merit badges”


Note to Counselor
Cooking is a life skills merit badge. It is expected that the
completion of this merit badge may take a longer period of time
than some of the other merit badges. The counselor should
keep the following in mind:
• The meals for this merit badge may be planned, prepared,
and cooked at different times. The goal is for the Scout to
understand each phase of meal planning by working on one
part of the process at a time. The meals planned and cooked
for this merit badge may not count for any other merit badge
or rank advancement.
• These requirements and the content of the Cooking merit
badge pamphlet were developed for the Boy Scouts of
America for use within the United States of America.
Adjustments should be made if traveling internationally.
Scouts working on this badge in summer camp should plan
around food they can get at the camp commissary.
• The first aid–related information found in this pamphlet is a
condensed version of that found in other BSA publications.
The counselor should be familiar with the additional informa-
tion on cooking and safety relevant to cooking found in the
Scouts BSA handbooks, Guide to Safe Scouting, First Aid merit
badge pamphlet, and BSA Fieldbook.
