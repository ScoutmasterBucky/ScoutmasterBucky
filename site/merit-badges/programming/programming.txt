more about the Cyber Chip at www.scouting.org/cyberchip.

programming and programming languages, and
discuss how programming languages have evolved
over time to become easier to use while adding
additional capabilities.

respect the terms of use of each.
5. Projects. Do the following:
		 a. 	With your counselor’s approval, choose a sample
program. Modify the code or add a function or
subroutine to it. Debug and demonstrate the modified
program to your counselor.
The Programming merit badge website, http://www.
boyslife.org/programming, has a number of sample
programs that you could use for requirement 5a.
However, you have the option of finding a program on
your own. It’s a good idea to seek your merit badge
counselor’s guidance.

		 b. 	With your counselor’s approval, choose a second programming language and development environment,
different from those used for requirement 5a and in
a different industry from 5a. Then write, debug, and
demonstrate a functioning program to your counselor,
using that language and environment.
		 c. 	With your counselor’s approval, choose a third programming language and development environment, different
from those used for requirements 5a and 5b and in a
different industry from 5a or 5b. Then write, debug, and
demonstrate a functioning program to your counselor,
using that language and environment.
		 d. 	Explain how the programs you wrote for requirements
5a, 5b, and 5c process inputs, how they make decisions
based on those inputs, and how they provide outputs
based on the decision making.
6. Careers. Find out about three career opportunities that
require knowledge in programming. Pick one and find out
the education, training, and experience required. Discuss
this with your counselor and explain why this career might
be of interest to you.
