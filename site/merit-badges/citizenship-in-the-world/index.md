1. Explain what citizenship in the world means to you and what you think it takes to be a good world citizen.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should formulate a written answer for this requirement prior to the class and be ready to share their work as a part of classroom discussion.{{/note}}
2. Explain how one becomes a citizen in the United States, and explain the rights, duties, and obligations of U.S. citizenship. Discuss the similarities and differences between the rights, duties, and obligations of U.S. citizens and the citizens of two other countries.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should have this written out to show the counselor that some thought and research has gone into this requirement and Scouts should be prepared to discuss their findings. Scouts will not automatically be signed off on this requirement just for attending as the requirement states that they must discuss a number of items and will be required to partake in group and/or individual discussion to obtain credit.{{/note}}
3. Do the following:
    (a) Pick a current world event. In relation to this current event, discuss with your counselor how a country's national interest and its relationship with other countries might affect areas such as its security, its economy, its values, and the health of its citizens.
    (b) Select a foreign country and discuss with your counselor how its geography, natural resources, and climate influence its economy and its global partnerships with other countries.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should be prepared to share their findings with the class and should be prepared with this requirement prior to the class. 1/2 of this requirement is preparation and research, the other 1/2 which will be facilitated in the class is the discussion. Scouts cannot complete this requirement by only doing one or the other, both parts must be done for each component. Scouts not coming to class with preparation work will find it difficult, if not impossible to complete this requirement on the day of the class. Preparation is a MUST for this requirement along with active class participation during the discussion.{{/note}}
4. Do TWO of the following:
    (a) Explain international law and how it differs from national law. Explain the role of international law and how international law can be used as a tool for conflict resolution.
    (b) Using resources such as major daily newspapers, the Internet (with your parent's permission), and news magazines, observe a current issue that involves international trade, foreign exchange, balance of payments, tariffs, and free trade. Explain what you have learned. Include in your discussion an explanation of why countries must cooperate in order for world trade and global competition to thrive.
    (c) Select TWO of the following organizations and describe their role in the world.
        (1) The United Nations and UNICEF

    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}This class will focus on requirements 4A and 4C. For both requirements, It is recommended that Scouts should formulate an answer prior to the class and be ready to share their work as a part of the classroom discussions.{{/note}}

    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Currently NO components of Requirement 7 are guaranteed to be covered in the class and will be at the discretion and resources of the individual counselor who may or may not provide classroom support for these.{{/note}}

    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}PLEASE NOTE HOWEVER: Scouts who can bring documented proof of completing any of these requirements will have an opportunity to share with the counselor their accomplishments and potentially be signed off on those requirements (remember completion of requirements is at the discretion of each individual counselor). It is STRONGLY recommended Scouts interested in completing this merit badge bring their work for requirement 7 to the class. If the work meets the satisfaction of the merit badge counselor, (saying you did it is not enough, you need to bring proof), most counselors will sign off on the requirement.{{/note}}
