        Scouts should be prepared to share their findings with the class
        and should be prepared with this requirement prior to the class.
        1/2 of this requirement is preparation and research, the other 1/2
        which will be facilitated in the class is the discussion. Scouts
        cannot complete this requirement by only doing one or the other,
        both parts must be done for each component. Scouts not coming to
        class with preparation work will find it difficult, if not
        impossible to complete this requirement on the day of the class.
        Preparation is a MUST for this requirement along with active class
        participation during the discussion.

        Currently NO components of Requirement 7 are guaranteed to be
        covered in the class and will be at the discretion and resources of
        the individual counselor who may or may not provide classroom
        support for these.

        PLEASE NOTE HOWEVER: Scouts who can bring documented proof of
        completing any of these requirements will have an opportunity to
        share with the counselor their accomplishments and potentially be
        signed off on those requirements (remember completion of
        requirements is at the discretion of each individual counselor).
        It is STRONGLY recommended Scouts interested in completing this
        merit badge bring their work for requirement 7 to the class. If the
        work meets the satisfaction of the merit badge counselor, (saying
        you did it is not enough, you need to bring proof), most counselors
        will sign off on the requirement.
