1. Do EACH of the following:
    (a) Describe three examples of safety equipment used in a chemistry laboratory and the reason each one is used.
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should be prepared to describe their findings for this portion of the requirement. It is suggested that any notes or references be brought with to the class in order to aid in completion.{{/note}}
    (b) Describe what a safety data sheet (SDS) is and tell why it is used.
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should research and formulate an answer that they can describe to the counselor during the class.{{/note}}
    (c) Obtain an SDS for both a paint and an insecticide. Compare and discuss the toxicity, disposal, and safe-handling sections for these two common household products.
        {{#note type="inPerson"}}This part of the requirement will be completed in the class however Scouts should be familiar with the requirement and its terms in order to be better prepared for discussion.{{/note}}

    (d) Discuss the safe storage of chemicals. How does the safe storage of chemicals apply to your home, your school, your community, and the environment?
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should review this requirement and its components and be prepared to discuss.{{/note}}
2. Do EACH of the following:
    (a) Predict what would happen if you placed an iron nail in a copper sulfate solution. Then, put an iron nail in a copper sulfate solution. Describe your observations and make a conclusion based on your observations. Compare your prediction and original conclusion with what actually happened. Write the formula for the reaction that you described.
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}This portion of requirement 2 will be completed in the class.{{/note}}
    (b) Demonstrate how you would separate sand (or gravel) from water. Describe how you would separate table salt from water, oil from water, and gasoline from motor oil. Name the practical processes that require these kinds of separations and how the processes may differ.
        {{#note type="inPerson"}}The first part of the requirement will be done in the class with the assistance of the counselor, however, prior to arrival at the class, Scouts should research and be prepared to describe how each is separated from the other. Scouts should also have at least one "process" sample for each of these in mind to share and how they differ from the others.{{/note}}
        {{#note type="online"}}The first part of the requirement will NOT be done in the class.  Scouts will need to procure sand and gravel and any necessary resources to be able to demonstrate the separation process as the requirement states during the class. The remaining parts of this requirement component will be discussed in the class however, prior to arrival at the class, Scouts should research and be prepared to describe how each is separated from the other. Scouts should also have at least one "process" sample for each of these in mind to share and how they differ from the others.{{/note}}
    (c) Describe the difference between a chemical reaction and a physical change.
        {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should bring any supporting notes to the class and be prepared to describe.{{/note}}
3. Construct a Cartesian diver. Describe its function in terms of how gases in general behave under different pressures and different temperatures. Describe how the behavior of gases affects a backpacker at high altitudes and a scuba diver underwater.
    {{#note type="inPerson"}}This requirement will be covered in the class.{{/note}}
    {{#note type="online"}}This requirement will NOT be covered in the class however, Scouts should utilize the CHemistry Merit Badge pamphlet or other source, to learn how to construct and bring their successfully constructed Cartesian diver to the class to share with the counselor / instructor and other Scouts for sign off consideration.{{/note}}
4. Do EACH of the following:
    (a) Cut a round onion into small chunks. Separate the onion chunks into three equal portions. Leave the first portion raw. Cook the second portion of onion chunks until the pieces are translucent. Cook the third portion until the onions are caramelized, or brown in color. Taste each type of onion. Describe the taste of raw onion versus partially cooked onion versus caramelized onion. Explain what happens to molecules in the onion during the cooking process.
        {{#note type="online"}}Scouts will need to do this requirement at home (with parental supervision) and come to the class with their findings.  Proof should be made with photographs of their experiment to show the counselor / instructor during the class that they actually did the experiment. Time will be allotted during the class to share their experienece with the counselor / instructor and other Scouts to complete the discussion parts of this requirement component. Only Scouts who can show the counselor / instructor proof that they actually did the onion experiment will be considered for sign off.{{/note}}
    (b) Describe the chemical similarities and differences between toothpaste and an abrasive household cleanser. Explain how the end use or purpose of a product affects its chemical formulation.
        {{#note type="online"}}Scouts should come prepared having reviewed the information in the merit badge pamphlet as it pertains to these requirements component for class discussion.{{/note}}
    (c) In a clear container, mix a half-cup of water with a tablespoon of oil. Explain why the oil and water do not mix. Find a substance that will help the two combine, and add it to the mixture. Describe what happened, and explain how that substance worked to combine the oil and water.
        {{#note type="online"}}Scouts should have the ingredients and supplies for this experiment to do as a part of the class under counselor / instructor guidance.  ALl Scouts will do this experiment as a part of the online class and share their results and findings as a part of the class discussion. Please do not do this experiment ahead of time.{{/note}}
    {{#note type="inPerson"}}All components of requirements 4 will be completed during the class as a part of this class. Scouts should come prepared having reviewed the information in the merit badge pamphlet as it pertains to these requirements.{{/note}}
5. List the five classical divisions of chemistry. Briefly describe each one, and tell how it applies to your everyday life.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts should review this requirement and be prepared to discuss. It is strongly recommended that Scouts bring any notes or supporting documents they may have to help show the counselor that they have prepared for discussion of these items.{{/note}}

    (b) Using resources found at the library and in periodicals, books, and the Internet (with your parent's permission), learn about two different kinds of work done by chemists, chemical engineers, chemical technicians, or industrial chemists. For each of the four positions, find out the education and training requirements.
    (c) Visit an industrial plant that makes chemical products or uses chemical processes and describe the processes used. What, if any, by-products are produced and how are they handled?
    (d) Visit a county farm agency or similar governmental agency and learn how chemistry is used to meet the needs of agriculture in your county.
    {{#note type="inPerson" type2="online"}}Scouts will need to do one of the options for requirement 7 prior to the class.
