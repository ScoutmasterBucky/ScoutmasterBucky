This module is designed for Venturing and Sea Scouts to explore
how science affects your life each day.
1. Choose A or B or C and complete ALL the requirements.
A. Watch about three hours total of science-related shows or documentaries that involve
projectiles, aviation, weather, astronomy, or space technology. Then do the following:
(1) Make a list of at least two questions or ideas from each show.

Channel. The NASA website at www.nasa.gov has some short multimedia clips that involve
projectiles, aviation, space, weather, astronomy, or aviation or space technology. You may choose
to watch a live performance or movie at a planetarium or science museum instead of watching a
media production. You may watch online productions with your counselor’s approval and under
your parent’s or guardian’s supervision.

3. Choose A or B and complete ALL the requirements.
A. Simulations. Find and use a projectile simulation applet on the Internet (with your
parent’s or guardian’s permission). Then design and complete a hands-on experiment to
demonstrate projectile motion.
(1) Keep a record of the angle, time, and distance.
(2) Graph the results of your experiment. (Note: Using a high-speed camera or
video camera may make the graphing easier, as will doing many repetitions
using variable heights from which the projectile can be launched.)

(3) Discuss with your counselor:
(a) What a projectile is
A projectile is:
• An object that is fired, launched, or thrown, but which cannot propel itself
• A self-propelled missile, like a rocket
(b) What projectile motion is
(c) The factors affecting the path of a projectile
When an object is fired, launched, or thrown, it is given horizontal velocity. (Velocity is the same
as speed, but it is speed in a given direction.) Once the object is launched, no additional force
providing horizontal velocity is applied. Newton’s First Law of Motion states that a body at rest
stays at rest and a body in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an outside force. If gravity
did not act on the projectile’s path, the object would continue to move in the direction in which it
was launched. Once the object has been launched, the only force acting upon it is the force of
gravity, which accelerates the object toward Earth.

Projectile motion is the curved path taken by an object that is fired, launched, or thrown. See
www.ncsec.org/cadre2/team1_2/pm.htm.

“Projectile Motion”: The Physics Classroom
Website: http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/vectors/u3l2a.cfm
Projectile motion is caused by the force of gravity giving vertical acceleration to an object that has
horizontal velocity. (When an object is thrown straight up in the air, the force of gravity slows it
down, it comes momentarily to a complete stop, then it accelerates downward.) An object that
has been launched will continue to move in the direction it was thrown at the speed with which it
was thrown, except for being slowed down by friction with the air (air resistance), but it will begin
to accelerate toward Earth, moving faster toward Earth all the time. The combination of constant
horizontal velocity and increasing downward velocity due to the acceleration of gravity is what
gives a projectile its curved path.

Forward velocity is the speed horizontal to Earth given to a projectile. If the projectile is thrown
parallel to Earth, all of its original speed will be its forward velocity. If an object is thrown at an
angle to Earth, the forward velocity is that portion of the velocity that is parallel to Earth.

(Determining forward velocity can be done by separating the velocity into horizontal and vertical
components—like on a triangle—using vector resolution.)
Forward velocity has a constant speed.
Acceleration due to gravity slows down things that are moving upward and speeds up things that
are moving downward. At most locations on Earth, the acceleration of gravity (9.80 m/s2, or
~32.174 ft/s2) will cause an object to fall 9.8 meters per second faster each second. An object
starting with no vertical motion will be falling toward Earth at the rate of 9.8 m/s at the end of
one second and at the rate of 19.6 m/s at the end of two seconds. Acceleration due to gravity is
constantly changing the vertical speed/ velocity of an object.
(d) The difference between forward velocity and acceleration due to gravity
B. Discover. Explain to your counselor the difference between escape velocity (not the
game), orbital velocity, and terminal velocity. Then answer TWO of the following
questions. (With your parent’s or guardian’s permission, you may explore websites to
find this information.)
(1) Why are satellites usually launched toward the east, and what is a launch
window?
Escape velocity is the speed at which an object will be able to escape the gravity of Earth, the moon,
or other body. An object must travel fast enough that it will not fall back to the surface. Escape
velocity from Earth is 11.2 km/s, or 25038.72 mph. Escape velocity is proportional to the square root
of the ratio between the mass of the larger body and the distance of the smaller object from the
center of the larger body.

Orbital velocity is achieved when an object’s horizontal velocity balances the acceleration of gravity at
that location in space. An object that has orbital velocity (is in orbit) continues to fall toward Earth as
it travels away from Earth, giving the object a circular path around Earth. The object continually falls
around Earth due to the combination of horizontal velocity and acceleration due to gravity.
Terminal velocity is the point at which the acceleration of gravity on an object matches the air
resistance of the object. Terminal velocity is affected by the weight of the object and its orientation.
(The more surface area that is horizontal to Earth, the lower the terminal velocity. Skydivers who
perform aerial displays use this fact. The first divers to jump lie flat to increase their air resistance.

Later divers streamline dive by holding their arms and legs tightly to their bodies and dive headfirst
toward Earth in order to catch the earlier divers in the air.)
Note: If it were not for air resistance, all objects, regardless of mass, size, or any other factor, would
fall at the SAME velocity.

Watch astronauts David Scott and Jim Irwin do Galileo’s experiment on the moon.

When satellites are launched to the east, Earth’s spin effectively adds to their velocity, making escape
velocity easier to obtain and requiring less fuel. Not all spacecraft are launched toward the east; the
launch direction depends also on the final orbit and purpose of the satellite. In order for a spacecraft
to rendezvous with another spacecraft or other object in space, the orbits of both objects must be
taken into consideration. A launch window describes a time period in which a mission must be
launched for the objects’ orbits to overlap.
(2) What is the average terminal velocity of a skydiver? (What is the fastest you
would go if you were to jump out of an airplane?)
Terminal velocity is when the acceleration due to gravity is matched by the air resistance (or
resistance of whatever fluid the object is traveling through). When the acceleration of gravity is
balanced by air resistance, the object continues to fall, but it does not increase its velocity.
“A person has a terminal velocity of about 200 mph when balled up and about 125 mph with arms
and feet fully extended to catch the wind.” Source: “Speed of a Skydiver (Terminal Velocity),” The
Physics Factbook, website http://hypertextbook.com/facts/JianHuang.shtml.
(3) How fast does a bullet, baseball, airplane, or rocket have to travel in order to
escape Earth’s gravitational field? (What is Earth’s escape velocity?)
