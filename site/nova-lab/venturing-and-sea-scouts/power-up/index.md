This module is designed to help Venturers or Sea Scouts explore how technology affects their life each day.

{{#requirements}}
1. Choose A or B or C and complete ALL the requirements.
    A. Watch about three hours total of technology-related shows or documentaries that involve transportation or transportation technology. Then do the following:
        (1) Make a list of at least two questions or ideas from each show.
        (2) Discuss two of the questions or ideas with your counselor.
        {{#note type="counselor"}}Some examples include — but are not limited to — shows found on PBS (“NOVA”), Discovery Channel, Science Channel, National Geographic Channel, TED Talks (online videos), and the History Channel. You may choose to watch a live performance or movie at a planetarium or science museum instead of watching a media production. You may watch online productions with your counselor’s approval and under your parent’s supervision.{{/note}}
    B. Read (about three hours total) about transportation or transportation technology. Then do the following:
        (1) Make a list of at least two questions or ideas from each article.
        (2) Discuss two of the questions or ideas with your counselor.
        {{#note type="counselor"}}Examples of magazines include — but are not limited to — Odyssey, Popular Mechanics, Popular Science, Science Illustrated, Discover, Air & Space, Popular Astronomy, Astronomy, Science News, Sky & Telescope, Natural History, Robot, Servo, Nuts and Volts, and Scientific American.{{/note}}
    C. Do a combination of reading and watching (about three hours total). Then do the following:
        (1) Make a list of at least two questions or ideas from each article or show.
        (2) Discuss two of the questions or ideas with your counselor.
2. Choose ONE STEM field of interest from the following list. Complete ALL the requirements for a [STEM exploration](../../venturing-and-sea-scouts-explorations/) in that field.
