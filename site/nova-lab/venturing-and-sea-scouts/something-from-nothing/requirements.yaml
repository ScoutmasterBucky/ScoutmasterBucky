                  Using either the model you made in part A or a different

                  Adjust the orientation of the print and note how the print
                  time changes and how much support material is needed at each
                  orientation.

                  print time required, as well as the amount of support
                  material required. Does the fastest print time require the
                  most support material? What is the best orientation for your
                  specific design? Why does the support material change with
                  different orientations, which gives the most efficient
                  results? Why does print time change with different
                  orientations, which gives the fastest results? Why would you
                  not use the orientation with the fastest print time or lowest
