This award explores the world of coding or computer programming. Once you know how to code, you can teach a computer to perform programs that help you in many ways.

    * {{#trim}}{{>badge-link badge="programming"}}{{/trim}}
    * {{#trim}}{{>badge-link badge="robotics"}}{{/trim}}
3. Explore different concepts in computer programming. Discuss these programming concepts with your counselor:
    A. What is the difference between a local and global variable?
        {{#note type="counselor"}}A Local variable is only defined and used within one routine. A global variable is defined for the entire program{{/note}}
    B. What are integer, Boolean, floating point, and character data types and what values can each of these data types hold?
        {{#note type="counselor"}}Integer – a variable that holds only whole numbers (e.g. 56, 7, -4, 23). Boolean – a variable that can hold only TRUE or FALSE.  Floating Point – a variable that can hold any real number (e.g. 71.045). Character variable – a variable that can hold only an alphanumeric character (e.g. “A”, “G”, “&”){{/note}}
    C. What is a scalar variable versus an array or list variable?
        {{#note type="counselor"}}A Scalar variable can only hold one value. An array or list variable can hold multiple values and each value can be selected using an index. (e.g. 5, 4, 10, -3 can be held in an integer array of size 4 called X. X[3] can refer to the 3rd element of the array){{/note}}
    D. What are these types of control flow instructions, and how do they work?
        (1) A While Loop
            {{#note type="counselor"}}A while loop continuously executes the code held in the loop while a condition that is checked at the beginning of the loop is TRUE and it exits the loop when the condition checked at the beginning of the loop becomes FALSE.{{/note}}
        (2) A Do-While Loop
            {{#note type="counselor"}}A Repeat loop continuously executes the code held in the loop while a condition checked at the end of the loop is TRUE and it exits the loop when the condition checked at the end of the loop becomes FALSE.{{/note}}
        (3) A For loop which performs a fixed number of iterations (i.e. For Loop)
            {{#note type="counselor"}}A For Loop executes the code held in the loop a fixed number of times.{{/note}}
        (4) An If statement
            {{#note type="counselor"}}An If statement executes a given computer instruction or a block of instructions if a condition is TRUE. It can also execute a different instruction or block of instructions if the condition is FALSE.{{/note}}
    E. What is a function and when is it used?
        {{#note type="counselor"}}A function is a block of instructions which computes a result and returns the result to the calling program. A program can branch to (or call) the function and then return back to where the function was called when the function completes. A function typically computes equations needed in multiple places in the program. (e.g. a function to calculate a polynomial given an input X value.){{/note}}
    F. What is a parameter to a function?
        {{#note type="counselor"}}A parameter is an input to a function used in the computation of the result.{{/note}}
    G. What is a key/value pair in a database?
        {{#note type="counselor"}}A Key/Value pair in database programming is a set of two linked data elements which allow the programmer to use a first key data element to find a result value based on the key (e.g. FirstName -> Joan, Lastname -> Smith){{/note}}
    H. What is a Universal Resource Locator (URL) and where is it used??
        {{#note type="counselor"}}A Universal Resource Locator (URL) is a set of characters which identify a resource such as a webpage or a file on the internet so a program or user may access the webpage or file.{{/note}}
4. In a programming language of your choosing, do the following:
    A. Write a program that determines if an input string of characters is a palindrome.
    B. Write a program of your choice from the following list.
        (1) A program that calculates the sum of a set of input numbers
        (2) A program to report the largest and the smallest numbers from a set of input numbers.
        (3) A program that calculates the average of a set of input numbers.
        (4) A program that calculates the factorial of an input number.
        (5) A program that calculates the sum of all numbers from a user input starting number to a user input ending number.

5. In a programming language that may be the same or different from the programming language used above, write a program selected from the following list. Work with your counselor to define the requirements – input from a user or from a file? Output to the screen or to a file? You may not use a GUI-based programming interface for this requirement, but a language like Python, Small Basic or Lisps (a family of powerful, syntax-light languages including Scheme or Common Lisp) would be appropriate.
    {{#note type="counselor"}}Palindrome - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome{{/note}}
    {{#note type="counselor"}}Factorials - https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/factorial.html{{/note}}
    A. A program that generates a random whole number between 1 and 10 and then asks the user to guess the number. When the guess is not correct, the program tells the user that the guess is too high or too low and then asks the user to try again. The program completes when the user correctly guesses the number.

    C. A program that accepts input, performs a calculation on the input and produces an output based on the input. It must use a function with one or more parameters to perform the calculation.
    D. A program that takes a set of at least 15 characters from a user and then displays the string in reverse order.

6. For the three programs you wrote for requirements 4 and 5, explain to your counselor how each of your programs works and why you chose the particular instructions and variables that you did.
7. Do ALL of the following requirements.
    A. Visit a company/school/institution where computer programs are being developed.
    B. Talk to someone there about how they use coding in their work. Write down at least five questions to ask the person you visit and review the answers with your counselor.
