This module is designed to help you explore how math affects your life each day.
1. Choose A or B or C or D and complete ALL the requirements.
A. Watch about three hours total of math-related shows or documentaries that involve
scientific models and modeling, physics, sports equipment design, bridge building, or
cryptography. Then do the following:
(1) Make a list of at least five questions or ideas from the show(s) you watched.
(2) Discuss two of the questions or ideas with your counselor.
Some examples include—but are not limited to—shows found on PBS (“NOVA”), Discovery
Channel, Science Channel, National Geographic Channel, TED Talks (online videos), and the History
Channel. You may choose to watch a live performance or movie at a planetarium or science
museum instead of watching a media production. You may watch online productions with your
counselor’s approval and under your parent’s or guardian’s supervision.
B. Research (about three hours total) several websites (with your parent’s or guardian’s
permission) that discuss and explain cryptography or the discoveries of people who
worked extensively with cryptography. Then do the following:
(1) List and record the URLs of the websites you visited and major topics covered
on the websites you visited. (You may use the copy and paste function—
eliminate the words—if you include your sources.)
(2) Discuss with your counselor how cryptography is used in the military and in
everyday life and how a cryptographer uses mathematics.

3. Choose TWO from A or B or C or D and complete ALL the requirements for the two you choose.
(Write down your data and calculations to support your explanation to your counselor. You may
use a spreadsheet. Do not use someone else’s data or calculations.)
A. Calculate your horsepower when you run up a flight of stairs.
Horsepower is a unit of power. One horsepower equals 33,000 foot-pounds of work per minute, or
745.6 watts. James Watt, who invented steam engines, based his unit of power on how much weight a
real horse could pull from a coal mine in one minute. See “What Is Horsepower” at www.webcars.com/math/ horsepower.html.

0down.
1. Find out how much you weigh in kilograms and write it down. (Multiply your weight in pounds
by 0.454 to get kilograms.)
2. Find a stair, ladder, or something similar (as long as it gets you upward).
3. Measure the height (not the length) of the stairs (or whatever you use) from the bottom to
the ending point at the top and write it down. This can be done by multiplying the height of
one stair by the number of stairs (it doesn’t matter how long the stairs are).

4. Take a running start toward the stairs. When you step on the first step, start the timer; when
both feet are on the top step, stop the timer. (You may skip stairs.) Now you have all the
numbers needed.
5. Calculate the Power (P) with this formula:
mah/t (m*9.80*h)/t, where m = mass (your weight) in kilograms
a = acceleration (9.80 m/sec2 is the acceleration caused by Earth’s gravity)
h = height of staircase in meters
t = time in seconds
The number you get is in watts, which is equal to joules per second (J/s) and newton meters per
second (Nm/s). If you don’t divide by time, you will calculate the energy needed to climb the
stairs.
Work = mah
Power = mah/t
Work (or energy) is measured in newton meters or joules; power is measured in joules/second or
watts.
6. Divide the number of watts by 745.6 w/hp to get the number in horsepower.

(1) How does your horsepower compare to the power of a horse?
(2) How does your horsepower compare to the horsepower of your favorite car?
Most car information packets and many websites list the horsepower of cars.
Share your calculations with your counselor, and discuss what you learned about horsepower.
B. Attend at least two track, cross country, or swim meets.
(1) For each meet, time at least three racers. (Time the same racers at each
meet.)
(2) Calculate the average speed of the racers you timed. (Make sure you record
your data and calculations.)
(3) Compare the average speeds of your racers to each other, to the official time,
and to their times at the two meets you attended. Share your calculations
with your counselor, and discuss your conclusions about the racers’ strengths
and weaknesses.
Average speed = Distance / Time

C. Attend a soccer, baseball, softball, or basketball game. Then choose two players. Keep
track of their efforts during the game. (Make sure you record your data and
calculations.) Calculate their statistics using the following as examples:
(1) Soccer—Goals, assists, corner kicks, keeper saves, fouls, offsides
(2) Baseball or softball—Batting average, runs batted in, fielding statistics,
pitching statistics
(3) Basketball—Points, baskets attempted, rebounds, steals, turnovers, and
blocked shots

4. Do ALL of the following:
A. Investigate your calculator and explore the different functions.
B. Discuss the functions, abilities, and limitations of your calculator with your counselor.
Talk about how these affect what you can and cannot do with a calculator. (See your
counselor for some ideas to consider.)
5. Discuss with your counselor how math affects your everyday life.
Here are some ideas for your Scout to consider. Pick a few or think of others.
• How can you add fractions using your calculator and get an answer in fraction form?
• How can you perform repeated calculations efficiently?
• How many digits in a numerical answer can your calculator display? What if the answer to your
calculation has more digits than your calculator can display? Can you figure out how many digits
your answer has? Can you figure out the hidden digits?
• How can you enter, store, recall, and use a list of data to perform data analysis calculations?
• For a calculator with graphing capabilities, how can you display a graph? Will a graphing
calculator always show the entire graph or does it sometimes show only a portion of the graph?
If it shows only a portion of the graph, how can you be certain that the portion you are viewing
shows the features you want to see?
• For numerical calculations, when does your calculator give exact answers and when does it give
approximate answers? What is the difference? How can you tell? Does it matter?
• If your calculator defaults to giving you an approximate answer, but you need an exact answer,
what do you do?
• If an approximate answer will do, how might your calculator’s internal calculation limitations
affect the accuracy of the approximation?
• For a calculator with graphing capabilities, how might pixel limitations affect its depiction of a
graph?
• Is the calculator always right? Why or why not? How might you tell? What might cause a
calculator to give you an incorrect answer? (For a graphing calculator, what might cause the
calculator to give you an incorrect graph, no graph, or a graph that cannot be readily
interpreted?)
• Are there numerical calculations that calculators can’t do? If possible, give an example.
