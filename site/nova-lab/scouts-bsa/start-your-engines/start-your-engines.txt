involve transportation or transportation technology. Then do the following:
(1) Make a list of at least two questions or ideas from the show(s) you watched.
(2) Discuss two of the questions or ideas with your counselor.
Some examples include—but are not limited to—shows found on PBS (“NOVA”), Discovery
Channel, Science Channel, National Geographic Channel, TED Talks (online videos), and the History
Channel. You may choose to watch a live performance or movie at a planetarium or science
museum instead of watching a media production. You may watch online productions with your

Examples of magazines include—but are not limited to—Odyssey, Popular Mechanics, Popular
Science, Science Illustrated, Discover, Air & Space, Popular Astronomy, Astronomy, Science News,
Sky & Telescope, Natural History, Robot, Servo, Nuts and Volts, and Scientific American.
C. Do a combination of reading and watching (about three hours total). Then do the
following:
(1) Make a list of at least two questions or ideas from each article or show.
(2) Discuss two of the questions or ideas with your counselor.

2. Complete ONE merit badge from the following list. (Choose one that you have not already used
toward another Nova award.) After completion, discuss with your counselor how the merit
badge you earned uses technology.

Automotive Maintenance
Aviation
Canoeing
Cycling
Drafting
Electricity

(1) Tell your counselor the energy source(s) used in these merit badges.
(2) Discuss the pros and cons of each energy source with your counselor.
B. Make a list of sources of energy that may be possible to use in transportation.
C. With your counselor:
(1) Discuss alternative sources of energy.
(2) Discuss the pros and cons of using alternative energy sources.

4. Design and build a working model vehicle (not from a kit).
A. Make drawings and specifications of your model vehicle before you begin to build.
B. Include one of the following energy sources to power your vehicle (do not use gasoline
or other combustible fuel source): solar power, wind power, or battery power.
C. Test your model. Then answer the following questions:
(1) How well did it perform?
(2) Did it move as well as you thought it would?
(3) Did you encounter problems? How can these problems be corrected?
D. Discuss with your counselor:
(1) Any difficulties you encountered in designing and building your model
(2) Why you chose a particular energy source
(3) Whether your model met your specifications
(4) How you would modify your design to make it better

5. Discuss with your counselor how technology affects your everyday life.

B. Make a list of sources of energy that may be possible to use in transportation.

C. With your counselor:
(1) Discuss alternative sources of energy.
(2) Discuss the pros and cons of using alternative energy sources.
Other sources of energy may include wind, solar power, and biofuels, which draw energy from what is
called biological carbon fixation. The most common biofuel is ethanol from corn, although it can also
come from sugar cane, sugar beets, wheat, molasses, potatoes, and fruit waste. Biodiesel sources
include algae, animal and vegetable oil, hemp, flax, and sunflowers.
