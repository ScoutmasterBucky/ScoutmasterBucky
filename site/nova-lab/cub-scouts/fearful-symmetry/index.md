This module is designed to help you explore how symmetry affects your life each day. Symmetry is something for which most people have an intuitive feel, but many have never thought about in enough detail to give names to all that they see. Symmetry is a way that a figure is like itself. Perhaps one side is a mirror image of the other (reflectional symmetry). Perhaps if you turned the image a little, you would get the same pattern (rotational symmetry). Perhaps there is a repeated pattern along a line, so that if you moved one “space” down, the pattern would repeat (translational symmetry).

Perhaps there is some combination of these. A common pattern is that the pattern repeats if you move down the line and reflect across the line, as happens with alternating leaf arrangement on a plant (glide reflection symmetry). There are far more patterns than names.

Symmetry is everywhere. Minerals organize themselves in crystals, which are repeating patterns. Plants and animals have many interesting symmetries in their shapes. Most artistic traditions in the world, and many activities where people design a shape for its function, depend on some form of symmetry. In this award, Scouts get to explore many aspects of this topic.
