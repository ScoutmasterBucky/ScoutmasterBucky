        (c) Use your models to guess which of the two minerals is harder.
3. Choose TWO options from A or B or C or D or E , and complete ALL the requirements for the options you choose.
    A. Make a paper lantern.
        1) Fold a large piece of paper in quarters lengthwise.
        2) Cut decorative or symbolic shapes into the two folded edges.

    B. Learn about the kolam artwork of southern India.
        1) Look at some pictures of kolams. Find as many similarities as possible within each kolam. Is there a repeated pattern? If you turn it a little, do you get the same picture? If you look at it in a mirror, do you get the same picture?
        2) Use sand, chalk dust, flour, or some other material to make a kolam of your own.
    C. Learn about the litema wall decorations from Lesotho and South Africa.
        1) Look at some pictures of litema. What does one basic tile look like? In how many ways can you see that tile arranged (turned a different direction, flipped backward, etc.)
        2) Use clay, paper, or some other material to make a litema of your own.
    D. Learn about the design of Navajo rugs.
        1) Look at some pictures of Navajo rugs. Find as many similarities as possible within each rug. Is there a repeated pattern? Is there a mirror image? How many?
        2) Using different colors of paper, or other materials, make your own Navajo-like rug.
    E. Learn about Seminole or Miccosukee patchwork designs.
        1) Look at some pictures of Seminole or Miccosukee patchwork. Find as many similarities as possible within each piece. What does a basic block of each pattern look like? How many different basic blocks are used in the design?
        2) Using different colors of paper, or other materials, make your own Seminolelike patchwork.
4. Visit a place where symmetry is important (such as an art exhibit, building site, or printer) or visit with a person who works with symmetry (such as an artist, interior designer, or landscape architect). Discuss with your counselor the symmetry or ideas of balance involved.
5. Discuss with your counselor how symmetry impacts your everyday life.
