    A Note to the Counselor
   </strong>
   <br>
   The Cub Scout Supernova award recognizes superior achievement by a Cub Scout in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
   <br>
   All experiments or projects should be conducted using the highest level of safety protocol and always under the supervision of a qualified, responsible adult.
   <br>
   Tigers are not eligible to earn the Cub Scout Supernova award.
   <br>
   Although it is not a requirement, it is recommended that you earn at least two Nova awards for Cub Scouts before earning the Dr. Luis W. Alvarez Supernova Award.
