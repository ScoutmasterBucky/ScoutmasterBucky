         Discuss with your mentor the following situation: Suppose you are writing a research paper and you find a resource in which the author’s words are so perfectly aligned with your perspectives and understanding that you cannot imagine a better way to put it in your paper than to use the author’s own words. How can you handle such a situation while still maintaining scholarly integrity?
        </li>
        <li>
         Discuss with your mentor the following situation: Suppose you are writing a research paper and you find resources with conflicting “facts” and/or conflicting conclusions. What are some viable strategies for resolving these conflicts and deciding which resources are trustworthy?

        <li>
         Discuss with your mentor the following situation: Suppose you are writing a research paper and have acquired dozens of resources.

       </ol>
      </li>

 <p>
  *If you are home-schooled, you may obtain a note from a counterpart such as your parent. If you are near the end of your current term, you may ask a current instructor. Otherwise, you should ask an instructor from the immediate past term.

   Using the guidelines found in the “
   <a href="https://www.scouting.org/stem-nova-awards/awards/venturer-supernova-exptopics/">
    Venturing STEM Explorations

  <li>
   Complete TWO
   <a href="https://www.scouting.org/stem-nova-awards/awards/venturer-supernova-topics/">
    Supernova activity
   </a>
   topics, one each in two different STEM areas.
  </li>
  <li>
   Participate in a local, state, or national science fair or mathematics competition OR in any equally challenging STEM-oriented competition or workshop approved by your mentor. An example of this would be an X-Prize type competition.
  </li>
  <li>
   Do ONE of the following:
   <br>
   <ol type="A">
    <li>
     Spend at least one day “shadowing” a local scientist or engineer. After your visit, discuss with your mentor your experience and what you learned about STEM careers.
    </li>
    <li>
     Learn about a career that is heavily involved with STEM. Make a presentation to your mentor about what you learned.
    </li>
   </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
   Working with your mentor, organize and present a Nova award or other STEM-related program at a Cub Scout den or pack meeting. Be sure to receive permission from the appropriate unit leader, and plan accordingly. If a Cub Scout den or pack is not available, your presentation may be given to another youth group.
  </li>
  <li>
   Review the scientific method (you may know this as the scientific process) and note how scientists establish hypotheses, theories, and laws. Compare how the establishment of “facts” or “rules” using the scientific method differs from the establishment of “facts” or “rules” in other environments, such as legal, cultural, religious, military, mathematical, or social environments. Then do each of the following:
   <br>
   <ol type="A">
    <li>
     Choose a current subject with at least two competing theories on the subject and learn as much as possible about each theory. Analyze the competing theories, decide which one is most convincing to you, and explain why to your mentor.
    </li>
    <li>
     Make a presentation to your mentor that describes the controversy, the competing theories, and your conclusions about how the scientific method can or cannot contribute to the resolution of the controversy.
