# Design and Redesign: Egg Drop Contest

This is a group activity and requires at least two youth. Your task is to design a container in which to place a raw egg, so that when the container with the egg is dropped, the egg survives the impact without breaking.

### Part 1: Research, Design, and Contest Set-Up

Research and describe to your mentor:

{{>show-requirements requirements=data.requirementsPart1}}

### Part 2: Analysis, Redesign, and Report

Analyze how your container performed, and discuss with your mentor your design strategy and how well the container you designed performed. Then do the following:

{{>show-requirements requirements=data.requirementsPart2}}
