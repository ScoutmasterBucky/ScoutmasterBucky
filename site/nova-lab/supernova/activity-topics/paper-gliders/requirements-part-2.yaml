      Evaluate the data and determine how the variations in the tested glider
      part influenced the flight characteristics you observed. Based on the
      data you gathered, predict how the glider would perform relative to the
      flight characteristics you observed if you were to build a glider with
      another variation in the same glider part.

      Suggest an ideal design of your tested glider part that would maximize
      the gliderâ€™s performance relative to the flight characteristics you
      observed and explain your reasoning for this design.

      Create a report that describes your glider, the flight tests, the flight
      data, and your conclusions. Include the procedures you followed to ensure
      consistent test conditions.
