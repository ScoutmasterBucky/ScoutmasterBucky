# Energy Technology

This activity can be done individually or in a group. The technology to harness energy has always been a significant factor in human progress. The harnessing of energy from wind, sun, water, biomass, fossil fuels, and other sources has evolved dramatically over time.

### Part 1: Field Trip

Arrange and go on a field trip to a site where you can learn about innovative and/or historical examples of energy production, storage, and use and the ways people are making such processes sustainable. Possible sites include power plants, fuel manufacturers or refineries, power generation sites, energy- or resource-efficient buildings, historical sites of energy use or production, educational centers, museums, and so on.

### Part 2: Analysis and Report

{{#requirements}}
1. Create a report that describes your field trip and what you learned.
