**{{>supernova-name}} Supernova Award**<br />*For Venturers and Sea Scouts*

You must be a Venturer or Sea Scout to earn a Venturing or Sea Scout Supernova award. With your parent’s and unit leader’s help, you must select a council-approved mentor who is a registered Scouter. You may NOT choose your parent or your unit leader (unless the mentor is working with more than one youth).

**A Note to the Mentor**

The Venturing and Sea Scout Supernova awards recognize superior achievement by a Venturer or Sea Scout in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). All experiments or projects should be conducted using the highest level of safety protocol and always under the supervision of a qualified, responsible adult.

**OPTION 1: Second-Level Supernova Award for Venturers and Sea Scouts**

For those who earned the {{>supernova-link supernova="dr-sally-ride" sa=true}} as a registered Venturer or Sea Scout.

{{#requirements}}
1. Earn the {{#trim}}{{>supernova-link supernova="dr-sally-ride" sa=true}}{{/trim}} while a registered Venturer.
2. Complete ONE additional [Venturer / Sea Scout Nova award](../../venturing-and-sea-scouts/) for a total of four. (Note: This may be done at any time after becoming a Venturer.)
3. Using the guidelines found in the [“Venturing STEM Explorations” chapter](../../explorations/), complete FOUR of the topics listed above. The four topics must be different from those completed while working on the {{#trim}}{{>supernova-link supernova="dr-sally-ride" sa=true}}{{/trim}}, for a total of eight different topics. (Note: These awards may be earned at any time after becoming a Venturer.)
4. Complete TWO additional [Supernova activity topics](../activity-topics/), one each in the two STEM areas not completed for the Dr. Sally Ride Supernova Award. (Note: The intent is that upon completion of the Wright Brothers Supernova Award, the Venturer will have completed one Supernova activity topic in each of the four STEM areas.)
5. Participate in a local, state, or national science fair or mathematics competition OR any other equally challenging STEM-oriented competition or workshop approved by your mentor. An example of this would be an X-Prize type competition. (Note: The intent is that upon completion of the Wright Brothers Supernova Award, the Venturer will have participated in two such events.)
6. Working with your mentor, organize and present a Nova awards or other STEM-related program at a Cub Scout den or pack meeting. Be sure to receive permission from the appropriate unit leader. If a Cub Scout den or pack is not available, your presentation may be given to another group. (Note: The intent is that upon completion of the Wright Brothers Supernova Award, the Venturer will have completed two such presentations.)
7. Research a scientific, technical, engineering, or mathematical breakthrough or invention of the past 100 years that has affected our society in a meaningful way. Develop your hypothesis on how this invention might further affect our society during your lifetime. Present either a 30-minute oral report or a 1,500-word written report to your mentor.
8. Submit an application to the district or council Nova or advancement committee for approval.

(Note: These awards may be earned at any time after becoming a Venturer.) Additional merit badges earned while in Scout BSA may not be used in lieu of the STEM explorations required for this award.
4. Complete TWO additional [Supernova activity topics](../activity-topics/), one each in the two STEM areas not completed for the Harris Supernova Award. (Note: The intent is that upon completion of the Wright Brothers Supernova Award, the Venturer will have completed one Supernova activity topic in each of the four STEM areas.)
5. Participate in a local, state, or national science fair or mathematics competition OR any other equally challenging STEM-oriented competition or workshop approved by your mentor.
