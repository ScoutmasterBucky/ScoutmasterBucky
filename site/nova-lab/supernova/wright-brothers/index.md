**{{>supernova-name}} Supernova Award**<br />*For Venturers and Sea Scouts*

You must be a Venturer or Sea Scout to earn a Venturing or Sea Scout Supernova award. With your parent’s and unit leader’s help, you must select a council-approved mentor who is a registered Scouter. You may NOT choose your parent or your unit leader (unless the mentor is working with more than one youth).

**A Note to the Mentor**

The Venturing and Sea Scout Supernova awards recognize superior achievement by a Venturer or Sea Scout in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). All experiments or projects should be conducted using the highest level of safety protocol and always under the supervision of a qualified, responsible adult.

# Requirements

{{#requirements}}
1. Earn the {{#trim}}{{>supernova-link supernova="dr-sally-ride" sa=true}}{{/trim}} while a registered Venturer or Sea Scout OR earn the {{#trim}}{{>supernova-link supernova="dr-bernard-harris" sa=true}}{{/trim}} while a registered Scout in Scouts BSA.
2. As a Venturer or Sea Scout complete ONE additional [Venturer/Sea Scout Nova award](../../venturing-and-sea-scouts/) for a total of four. The Nova award completed is to be different from any Nova awards previously completed.
3. Using the guidelines for [Venturing/Sea Scout STEM Explorations](../../explorations/), complete STEM explorations for four of the topics listed below. Use of Scouts BSA Merit Badge content is encouraged.
    Animal Science, Archaeology, Architecture, Astronomy, Automotive Maintenance, Aviation, Bird Study, Chemistry, Composite Materials, Computers, Dentistry, Drafting, Electricity, Electronics, Energy, Engineering, Environmental Science, Farm Mechanics, Fish and Wildlife Management, Forestry, Gardening, Geocaching, Geology, Insect Study, Inventing, Mammal Study, Medicine, Nature, Nuclear Science, Oceanography, Plant Science, Pulp and Paper, Radio, Reptile and Amphibian Study, Robotics, Scuba Diving, Soil and Water Conservation, Space Exploration, Surveying, Veterinary Medicine, Weather, Welding.
4. Complete TWO additional [Supernova activity topics](../activity-topics/), one each in the two STEM areas not completed for the {{#trim}}{{>supernova-link supernova="dr-sally-ride" sa=true}}{{/trim}} or {{#trim}}{{>supernova-link supernova="dr-bernard-harris" sa=true}}{{/trim}}.  (Upon completion of the {{#trim}}{{>supernova-name supernova="wright-brothers" sa=true}}{{/trim}}, the Venturer/Sea Scout will have completed one Supernova activity topic in each of the four STEM areas.)
5. Participate in a local, state, or national science fair or mathematics competition OR any other equally challenging STEM-oriented competition or workshop approved by your mentor. An example of this would be an X-Prize type competition. (Note: The intent is that upon completion of the {{#trim}}{{>supernova-name supernova="wright-brothers"}}{{/trim}}, the Venturer/Sea Scout will have participated in two such events.)
6. Working with your mentor, organize and present a Nova award or other STEM-related program at a Cub Scout den or pack meeting. Be sure to receive permission from the appropriate unit leader. If a Cub Scout den or pack is not available, your presentation may be given to another group. (Note: The intent is that upon completion of the {{#trim}}{{>supernova-name supernova="wright-brothers" sa=true}}{{/trim}}, the Venturer/Sea Scout will have completed two such presentations.)
7. Research a scientific, technical, engineering, or mathematical breakthrough or invention of the past 100 years that has affected our society in a meaningful way. Develop your hypothesis on how this invention might further affect our society during your lifetime. Present either a 30- minute oral report or a 1,500-word written report to your mentor.
8. Submit [your application](../award-application.pdf) to the district or council Nova or advancement committee for approval.
