# Supernova Awards

These awards are ways to reward Scouts for learning more about Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) subjects. The Supernova awards are earned as the next step after achieving Nova awards. There are different Nova awards for each program: [Cub Scouts](../cub-scouts/), [Scouts BSA](../scouts-bsa/), and [Venturing and Sea Scouts](../venturing-and-sea-scouts/).
