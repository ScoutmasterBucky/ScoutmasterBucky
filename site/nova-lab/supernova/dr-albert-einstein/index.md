**{{>supernova-name}} Supernova Award**<br />*For Venturers and Sea Scouts*

You must be a Venturer or Sea Scout to earn a Venturing or Sea Scout Supernova award. With your parent’s and unit leader’s help, you must select a council-approved mentor who is a registered Scouter. You may NOT choose your parent or your unit leader (unless the mentor is working with more than one youth).

**A Note to the Mentor**

The Venturing and Sea Scout Supernova awards recognize superior achievement by a Venturer or Sea Scout in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). All experiments or projects should be conducted using the highest level of safety protocol and always under the supervision of a qualified, responsible adult.

**NOTE: A youth must be a registered Venturer or Sea Scout when this work is completed in order to this award.**

**Third-Level Supernova Award for Venturers and Sea Scouts**

{{#requirements}}
1. Earn either the {{#trim}}{{>supernova-link supernova="thomas-alva-edison" sa=true}}{{/trim}} while a registered Scouts BSA member or the {{#trim}}{{>supernova-link supernova="wright-brothers" sa=true}}{{/trim}} while a registered Venturer.
2. Complete FOUR additional [Supernova activity topics](../venturing-and-sea-scouts-activity-topics/), one in each of the four different STEM areas. (Note: The intent is that upon completion of the Dr. Albert Einstein Supernova Award the Venturer will have completed two Supernova activity topics in each of the four STEM areas for a total of eight.)
3. Create and propose a new Nova awards topic for any program ([Cub Scout](../../cub-scouts/), [Webelos](../../cub-scouts/), [Scouts BSA](../../scouts-bsa/), or [Venturing / Sea Scouts](../../venturing-and-sea-scouts/)) comparable to the existing Nova awards topics at that program level. Prepare a written outline for this proposed Nova awards topic and submit it to your mentor.
4. With guidance from your mentor, select an area of current STEM-related concern and develop a research project or experiment related to that area. Prepare a one-page written proposal detailing your scientific hypothesis or engineering objective and your proposed experimental methods, which must be approved by the National STEM in Scouting Committee before you begin work.  This research project or experiment should be challenging and should require a significant investment of time and effort on your part. (A guideline would be approximately 100 hours.) If your mentor is not a specialist in the area of your project or experiment, he or she will solicit assistance from a specialist who to serve as a STEM consultant. Execute the project or experiment. Prepare a complete and well-documented written report AND an oral presentation. Present both to your mentor and your local council STEM in Scouting committee.
5. Submit an application to the national STEM in Scouting committee for approval.
