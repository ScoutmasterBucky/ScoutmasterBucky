    Supernova activity topics
   </a>
   , one in each of the four different STEM areas. (Note: The intent is that upon completion of the Dr. Albert Einstein Supernova Award the Venturer will have completed two Supernova activity topics in each of the four STEM areas for a total of eight.)
  </li>
  <li>
   Create and propose a new Nova awards topic for any program (Cub Scout, Webelos, Boy Scouts, or Venturing) comparable to the existing Nova awards topics at that program level. Prepare a written outline for this proposed Nova awards topic and submit it to your mentor.
  </li>
  <li>
   With guidance from your mentor, select an area of current STEM-related concern and develop a research project or experiment related to that area. Prepare a one-page written proposal detailing your scientific hypothesis or engineering objective and your proposed experimental methods, which must be approved by the National STEM in Scouting Committee before you begin work (
   <a href="mailto:einstein@scouting.org">
    einstein@scouting.org
   </a>
   ).  This research project or experiment should be challenging and should require a significant investment of time and effort on your part. (A guideline would be approximately 100 hours.) If your mentor is not a specialist in the area of your project or experiment, he or she will solicit assistance from a specialist who to serve as a STEM consultant. Execute the project or experiment. Prepare a complete and well-documented written report AND an oral presentation. Present both to your mentor and your local council STEM in Scouting committee.
