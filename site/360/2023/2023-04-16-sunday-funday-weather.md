Over the past week we have experienced the near extremes of all four seasons here in Minnesota. With temperatures ranging from below freezing to the scorching 90's, the weather has been crazy.

Check out the video for a fun retro look at "Sunshine Day" by the Brady Bunch, and comment in the video post NAME A "WEATHER" SONG in the comments - and try not to repeat what has already been posted. Shame on whomever breaks the chain and posts a repeat.
