***"'America has many good things to give you and your children after you. But, these good things depend on the qualities she instills in her citizens. As an Eagle Scout, you are prepared to help America in all that she needs most. She has a great past, and you are here to make her future even greater.'"*** *taken from the Boy Scouts of America Eagle Challenge*
