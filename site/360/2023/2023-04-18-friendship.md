Ben didn't come with any topic specifically in mind, but our frienship was at the core of all that we enjoyed and discussed during his time with me today.  He sums things up really nice near the end of the video, we can go for years without seeing each other, but it takes mere second and we pick things up as if we hadn't missed a day away from each other.

They say if you have just one good friend in life you are doing well, as evidenced by today's video, as well as those past and upcoming, I am more than blessed with a large number of people I can call TRUE FRIENDS. Don't take your friends for granted, I certainly know I don't.
