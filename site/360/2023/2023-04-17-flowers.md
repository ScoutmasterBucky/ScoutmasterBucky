I got that song stuck in my head due to the fact that it will soon be time to plant some flowers.  As such, I started thinking about the different flowers to plant and somehow got on the idea of trying to name a flower that starts with each letter of the alphabet.  I didn't ponder too long and took the first flower that came to mind for that letter, although I must admit, there were a few I had to Google.

Think Spring!
