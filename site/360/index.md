In November 2022, shortly after Thanksgiving, I (Scoutmaster Bucky) was initially diagnosed with Stage 4 Prostate Cancer.  Over these initial 4 months, navigating the unknown, discovering good and bad, grasping mortality and faith, traversing the highs and lows, and redefining life ambitions and goals, I present the **<span class="C(red)">&lt;3</span>60 Awareness Project**.

This initiative is to get people talking... to help bring awareness to causes, issues, and organizations; to help broaden your own self and social awareness.

60 days, 60 topics, 60 seconds.
