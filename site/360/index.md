## 2023 <span class="C(red)">&lt;3</span>60 Awareness Project

In November 2022, shortly after Thanksgiving, I (Scoutmaster Bucky) was initially diagnosed with Stage 4 Prostate Cancer.  Today, March 27, 2023 I am publicly announcing my diagnosis.  Over these initial 4 months of navigating the unknown, discovering good and bad, strengthening my faith, realizing mortality, traversing the highs and lows, and redefining life ambitions and goals I have decided to embark on what I call the "<360 Awareness Project".

This initiative is to get people talking... to help bring awareness to causes, issues, and organizations and to help broaden your own self and social awareness.

Over the next 60 days I will introduce 60 different topics with a 60 second video or 60 second read, to spark the conversation.  I have asked a number of different people in my life to join me each morning as I go through my 60 days of radiation treatment.  Check in each day to find out who came with me, what topic they selected to help bring awareness to, as well as a few surprises.  Let's have a little fun, laugh out loud a lot, and get people talking.

Look below for a link to each day. The underlying detail page which will contain deeper insight and information with links to resources on each day's topic.

The <360 Awareness Project is a Scoutmaster Bucky compassionate initiative to help bring awareness, share love, and show support to everyone in whatever challenges they may face throughout their life.

Let the Scoutmaster Bucky Team know if you have any questions or comments by emailing us at ScoutmasterBucky@yahoo.com or commenting on our Facebook page.
