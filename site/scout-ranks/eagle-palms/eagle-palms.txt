EAGLE PALMS
After successfully completing your Eagle Scout board of review on or
after Aug. 1, 2017, and being validated as an Eagle Scout by the National
Service Center, you will be entitled to receive an Eagle Palm for each
additional five merit badges you completed before your Eagle board of
review beyond those required for Eagle. In addition, all current Scouts
who have completed their Eagle board of review and who had not
passed their 18th birthday before Aug. 1, 2017, are entitled as well to
receive Eagle Palms. For these Palms only, it will not be necessary for
you to complete the requirements stated below.
After becoming an Eagle Scout and receiving the Eagle Palms you are
entitled to, you may earn additional Palms by completing the
following requirements:
1. Be active in the Boy Scouts of America for at least three
months after becoming an Eagle Scout or after the last Palm
was earned.15
2. Since earning the Eagle Scout rank or your last Eagle Palm,
demonstrate Scout spirit by living the Scout Oath and Scout
Law. Tell how you have done your duty to God and how you
have lived the Scout Oath and Scout Law in your everyday life.
3. Continue to set a satisfactory example of accepting responsibility
or demonstrating leadership ability.
4. Earn five additional merit badges beyond those required for
Eagle or last Palm.16
5. While an Eagle Scout, participate in a Scoutmaster conference.
Notes: For Venturers working on Scouts BSA requirements, replace “Scoutmaster” with “crew Advisor.” For Sea Scouts
working on Scouts BSA requirements, replace “Scoutmaster” with “Skipper.”
15Eagle Palms must be earned in sequence, and the three-month tenure requirement must be observed for each Palm.
16Merit badges earned any time since joining Scouts BSA may be used to meet this requirement.
You may wear only the proper combination of Palms
for the number of merit badges you earned beyond the
rank of Eagle. The Bronze Palm represents five merit
badges, the Gold Palm 10, and the Silver Palm 15.
