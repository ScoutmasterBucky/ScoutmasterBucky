All requirements for the First Class rank must be completed as a member of a troop or as a Lone Scout.

The requirements for Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, and First Class ranks may be worked on simultaneously; however, these ranks must be earned in sequence.

[Alternate requirements for the First Class rank](../alternative-requirements/) are available for Scouts with physical or mental disabilities if they meet the criteria listed in the **Scouts BSA Requirements** book.
