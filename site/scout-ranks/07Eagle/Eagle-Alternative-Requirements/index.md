### Eagle Scout Alternative Rank Requirements
The Eagle Scout rank may be achieved by a Scouts BSA Scout or a qualified Venturer or Sea Scout who has a physical or mental disability by completing the [Application for Alternative Eagle Scout Rank Merit Badges, No. 512-730](https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/512-730.pdf), and by qualifying for alternative merit badges. This does not apply to individual requirements for merit badges. Merit badges are awarded only when all requirements are met as stated. See the [Guide to Advancement, topic 10.2.2.3](https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/special-needs/#10223), for details.

 The physical or mental disability must be of a permanent rather than of a temporary nature (or a disability expected to last more than two years or beyond the 18th birthday). The application must include a written statement from a qualified health-care professional related to the nature of the disability. This person may be a physician, neurologist, psychiatrist, psychologist, etc., or an educational administrator as appropriate.

Before applying, a Scout must earn as many of the Eagle-required merit badges as possible. However, where a permanent disability clearly precludes completing specific merit badges, a Scout who has earned at least First Class may apply for an alternative merit badge without waiting until all other Eagle-required merit badges are complete. Any alternatives must present the same challenge and learning level as those they replace, and must be completed by the 18th birthday unless the member is registered beyond the age of eligibility (reference [Guide to Advancement, topic 10.1.0.1 - 10.1.0.2](https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/special-needs/).
## Eagle Scout Alternative Rank Requirements

{{#requirements}}
1. Obtain a clear and concise statement related to the nature of the disability from a qualified health-care professional.

2. The unit leader meets with the candidate and his parent or guardian to determine the alternative merit badges to replace those impeding his progression.

3. The unit leader, parent or guardian, and the Scout (if possible) prepare supporting letters to accompany the application.

4. The district and council advancement committees, in turn, review the proposed alternative merit badges. They may choose to speak with the Scout, his parent or guardian, or unit leader. If the council advancement committee approves, then the candidate may start work on the merit badges.

    *Note: In approving the application, the district and council advancement committees must utilize the expertise of a health-care professional involved with youth who have disabilities.*

5. Upon completion of the Eagle Scout rank requirements, using the alternative merit badges, the candidate appears before a board of review. This approved [Application for Alternative Eagle Scout Rank Merit Badges](https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/512-730.pdf) must be attached to the [Eagle Scout Rank Application](https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/512-728_wb_fillable.pdf).

6. Following a successful board of review, the council processes both applications and forwards them to the national Advancement Team. Local council action on alternative merit badges does not require national approval.
