###  APPEALS AND EXTENSIONS

If a Scout believes all requirements for the Eagle Scout rank have been completed but a board of review is denied, the Scout
may request a board of review under disputed circumstances in accordance with [Guide to Advancement topic 8.0.3.2.](https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/boards-of-review/#8032)

If the board of review does not approve the Scout’s advancement, the decision may be appealed in accordance with
[Guide to Advancement topic 8.0.4.0.](https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/boards-of-review/#8040)

A Scout who foresees that, due to no fault or choice of their own, it will not be possible to complete the Eagle Scout
rank requirements before age 18 may [apply for a limited time extension](https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/512-077.pdf) in accordance with [Guide to Advancement topic 9.0.4.0.](https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/eagle-scout-rank/#9040) These are rarely granted and reserved only for work on Eagle

###  AGE REQUIREMENT ELIGIBILITY

Merit badges, badges of rank, and Eagle Palms may be earned by a registered Scout or a qualified Venturer or Sea
Scout. Scouts may earn these awards until their 18th birthday. Any Venturer or Sea Scout who has achieved the First
Class rank as a Scout in a troop or as a Lone Scout may continue working up to their 18th birthday toward the Star,
Life, and Eagle Scout ranks and Eagle Palms.

An Eagle Scout board of review may occur, without special approval, within three months after the 18th birthday.
Local councils must preapprove those held three to six months afterward. To initiate approval, the candidate, the candidate’s parent or guardian, the unit leader, or a unit committee member attaches to the application a statement
explaining the delay. Consult the [Guide to Advancement, topic 8.0.3.1.](https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/boards-of-review/#8031) , in the case where a board of review is to be conducted more than six months after a candidate’s 18th birthday.

If you have a permanent physical or mental disability, or a disability expected to last more than two years or beyond
age 18, you may become an Eagle Scout by qualifying for as many required merit badges as you can and qualifying for
alternative merit badges for the rest. If you seek to become an Eagle Scout under this procedure, you must submit a
special application to your local council service center. Your application must be approved by your council advancement committee before you can work on alternative merit badges.

A Scout, Venturer, or Sea Scout with a disability may also qualify to work toward rank advancement after reaching 18
years of age if the guidelines outlined in [section 10 of the Guide to Advancement](https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/special-needs/) are met.
