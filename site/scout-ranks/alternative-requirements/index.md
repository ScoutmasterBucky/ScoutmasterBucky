### Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, and First Class Rank Alternative Requirements

A Scout who has a permanent physical or mental disability (or a disability expected to last more than two years or beyond the 18th birthday) and is unable to complete all of the requirements for Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, or First Class rank may, with his parents or guardian, submit a request to the council advancement committee to complete alternative requirements. Below are the procedures for applying for alternative requirements. To help facilitate this process, use the [Individual Scout Advancement Plan](https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/512-936_wb.pdf), No. 512-936, which can be found at [www.scouting.org/advancement](http://www.scouting.org/advancement). For more detailed information about alternative requirements, see the [Guide to Advancement](https://www.scouting.org/resources/guide-to-advancement/contents/).
