## New Website Design

The new website design is courtesy of a very talented and gracious Scouter who was helped to make the Scoutmaster Bucky website more intuitive and mobile friendly as well. The new design is a work in progress. We will continue to update pages to reflect more detailed information and features.

In an effort to minimize usefulness we have focused on the areas that we get the most feedback and interest in to focus on. The Requirements pages are current and up-to-date with 2020 requirements, the Class Preparation Pages and Workbook pages are methodically being worked on to enhance their current information and features. We anticipate by the end of October 2020, these areas will be fully reviewed and updated accordingly. Priority to the merit badge offerings and their respective Class Preapration pages and Workbook pages is on the top of the list.

We will be adding back the historical pages in the near future along with more content that is useful to all Scouts and Scouters. We will remain ad free and focused on our Scouting community for proviiding useful information and opportunities.
