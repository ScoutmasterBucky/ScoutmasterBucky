The BSA Stand Up Paddleboarding award introduces Scouts to the basics of stand up paddleboarding (SUP) on calm water. They’ll learn about the necessary skills, equipment, self-rescue, and safety precautions. This award also encourages Scouts to develop paddling skills that promote fitness and safe aquatics recreation.

Stand Up Paddleboarding (SUP) originated as an offshoot of surfing. It is still used in the surf and has expanded into whitewater. Stand Up Paddleboarding in the surf or whitewater requires skills beyond those covered in the BSA Stand Up
Paddleboarding award. Such skills are best acquired from qualified instruction.

The U.S. Coast Guard considers stand up paddleboards as vessels when they are used outside of designated swim areas or ocean surfing zones. Therefore, federal regulations concerning life jackets, sound devices, and lights apply

<div>
<p>Any person approved by the council, who is trained in *BSA Safety Afloat* and recognized as a SUP instructor by the ACA | Canoe - Kayak - SUP - Raft - Rescue or equivalent organization may serve as a counselor for this award. An ACA Level 1 or Level 2 Stand Up Paddleboarding Assessment Course or ACA Instructor certification is strongly recommended.</p>

<p>There should be one qualified counselor for every six Scouts. Ratios of
youth to adults must also meet the BSA Youth Protection policies. Everyone must be monitored by a buddy,
including the instructor. The instructor’s buddy may serve as an assistant on the water or as a lookout on land if the
instruction is close enough to shore for easy verbal communication. The instructor’s buddy must know enough to
realize when the instructor is having difficultly rather than demonstrating a fall.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, participants earn the BSA Stand Up Paddleboarding patch along with their achievement card.  Completion indicates the individual has experienced a valuable introduction to stand up paddleboarding.</p>
