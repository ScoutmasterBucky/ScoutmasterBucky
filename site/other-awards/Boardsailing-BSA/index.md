Boardsailing BSA helps introduce basic boardsailing skills, equipment, and safety precautions; to encourage the development of skills that promote fitness and safe aquatic recreation; and to lay a foundation for more advanced and demanding boardsailing activities. It serves as a year-round program opportunity for Scouts BSA and Venturing units and is well-suited for older Scouts at summer camp.

All counselors must be trained in Safety Afloat and have council approval. Any person recognized as a boardsailing instructor by US Windsurfing or US Sailing, or someone with similar experience in boardsailing skills, safety, and instruction, may serve as a counselor for this award.

Instruction must be conducted on a protected body of water in an area free from other traffic or large waves. Initial water entry and practice should be on a gradual beach clear of hazards. A steady three-to-seven knot breeze is ideal for beginner practice. All participants should be close enough to supervisory personnel for efficient instruction and ready assistance.

Basic skills and safety precautions are presented in the BSA publication: [Aquatics Supervision - Leader's Guide](https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/Outdoor%20Program/Aquatics/pdf/Aquatics_34346.pdf).
