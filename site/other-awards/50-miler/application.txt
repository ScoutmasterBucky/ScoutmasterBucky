THE 50-MILER PROGRAM
The primary objective of this
program is to stimulate Scouts
BSA, Sea Scout, and Venturer
interest in the ideals of the movement
and to promote activity that will
result in personal fitness, self-reliance,
know-ledge of wood lore, water trek,
and/or outdoor experience.
Chartered unit participation is most desirable;
however, provisional Scouting units are eligible. This award does
not apply if any other BSA award is available for a trip.
The Scouts BSA, Sea Scout, or Venturing unit or provisional
group must follow these rules for a 50-Miler trip:
• Select a suitable trail or waterway.
• Two-deep leadership must be in effect at all times. Adult leadership
should utilize and follow the Guide to Safe Scouting.
• Groups shall complete the 50 miles / 5 day trip by sailboat, canoe,
on foot, by horse, or by bicycle.
Award Requirements
The 50-Miler Award is presented to each qualifying individual for
satisfactory participation in an approved trip. In order to qualify for the
award, the group of which the individual is a member must fulfill all of
the following requirements:
1. Make complete and satisfactory plans for the trip, including
the possibilities of advancement, conservation, leadership,
and service.
2. Cover the route of not less than 50 consecutive miles; take a mini-
mum of five consecutive days to complete the trip without the aid
of motors for the qualification of the 50-mile distance. For example,
in the case of water treks and the use of motors, qualification dis-
tances exclude maneuvering in or out of slips or ports, safety/
weather transverses, managing tidal currents, and accessing the
open water. (In some areas pack animals may be used.) Note:
Qualification for the 50-mile distance does not have to be continu-
ous, provided the primary purpose objective is met.
3. During the time on the trail or waterway, complete a minimum of
10 hours each of group work on projects to improve the trail,
springs, campsite, portage, or area. If, after checking with
recognized authorities, it is not possible to complete 10 hours each
of group work on the trail, a similar project may be done in the
unit’s home area. (There should be no unauthorized cutting of
brush or timber.)
4. Unit or tour leader must then file the 50-Miler Award application
with the local council service center.
Detach and send the report below to your local council service center.
