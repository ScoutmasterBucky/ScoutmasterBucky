**Note:** *The Firem'n Chit patch is considered a 'Temporary Patch' and, if worn, should be worn centered on the RIGHT pocket of the Scout uniform, NOT on the pocket flap. If desired, it is acceptable to place the Firem'n Chit patch on the back of your sash.*

Building a campfire is a crucial skill for scouting. Not only is it a real-world survival technique, but sitting around the fire is a great way to get to know your fellow scouts and make life-long friendships. Fires can be used for cooking, for fellowship and for warmth. There are many ways to start a fire, but no matter how the fire is started, it's important to practice good fire safety.

The Firem’n Chit is a contract for Scouts who have demonstrated the proper procedures for starting, maintaining, and extinguishing lighting devices, cooking fires, campfires, and lanterns to uphold these safe practices.

## Firem'n Chit Award
<p>The Firem'n Chit may be earned by members of Scouts BSA, Venturing, Sea Scouts, and Webelos Scouts in Cub Scouts. Certification grants a Scout the right to carry matches and build campfires. Scouts must show their Scout leader, or someone designated by their leader, that they understand their responsibility to do the eight requirements.</p>

<p>Scouts should carry their Firem'n Chit card to all Scout events or activities where they might be working with fire. This certification grants a Scout the right to carry fire-lighting devices (matches, lighters, etc.) and to build campfires or cooking fires. Scouts may not manage a campfire, cooking fire, or light a lantern without being in posession of their Firem'n Chit card.</p>

<p>The Scout’s “Firem’n Rights” can be taken if they fail in their responsibility. Typically, corners are cut from the Firem’n Chit card for each infraction. If four corners are cut away or a Scout conducts a serious infraction with fire, the card is taken away. Scouts will have to re-earn thier Firem'n Chit by re-taking Firem'n Chit training from a senior scout or adult leader.</p>
