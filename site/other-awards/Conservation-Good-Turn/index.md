Since 1910, conservation has been an integral part of the program of the Boy Scouts of America. The BSA has been a positive force in conservation and environmental efforts. Scouts have rendered distinguished public service by helping to conserve wildlife, energy, forests, soil, and water. Past generations of Scouts have been widely recognized for undertaking conservation Good Turn action projects in their local communities.

Scouts of today have grown up hearing words such as ecosystem, biodiversity, and climate change. They recognize the need for, and the benefits of, conserving natural resources. Scouts understand that we all must work together for the betterment of the land, forests, wildlife, air, and water.

The Conservation Good Turn award is to encourage packs, troops, crews, and ships to join with conservation or environmental organization (federal, state, local or private) to carry out a Conservation Good Turn in their home communities.

## Conservation Good Turn Requirements

The Conservation Good Turn Award is an opportunity for Cub Scout packs, Scouts BSA troops, Venturing crews, or Sea Scout ships to join with conservation or environmental organizations (federal, state, local, or private) to carry out a conservation Good Turn in their home communities.

    - The Scouting unit contacts a conservation agency and offers to carry out a Good Turn project.
    - The agency identifies a worthwhile and needed project that the unit can accomplish.
    - Working together in the local community, the unit and the agency plan the details and establish the date, time, and location for carrying out the project.

*Scouts participating in the Conservation Good Turn can meet certain rank and merit badge requirements. Troops, crews and ships should consider advancement requirements when selecting projects to carry out.*

Recognitions items include a certificate for the unit and a patch for participating youth and adult members.

{{#requirements}}
1. Make complete and satisfactory plans for the trip, including the possibilities of advancement.
2. Cover the route of not less than 50 consecutive miles; take a minimum of five consecutive days to complete the trip without the aid of motors for the qualification of the 50-mile distance.  For example, in the case of water treks and the use of motors, qualification distances exclude manuvering in or out of slips or ports, safety/weather traverses, managing tidal currents, and accessing the open water. (In some areas pack animals may be used.) *NOTE: Qualification for the 50-mile distance does not have to be continuous, provided the primary purpose objective is met.*
3. During the time on the trail or waterway, complete a minimum of 10 hours each of group work on projects to improve the trail, springs, campsite, portage, or area. If, after checking with recognized authorities, it is not possible to complete 10 hours each of group work on the trail, a similar project may be done in the unit's home area. (There should be no unauthorized cutting of brush or timber.)
4. Unit or tour leader must then file a 50-Miler Award application with the local council service center.
