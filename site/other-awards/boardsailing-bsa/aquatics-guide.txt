A Word About Youth Protection
Child abuse is a serious problem in our society, and unfortunately, it can occur anywhere, even in Scouting. Youth
safety is of paramount importance to Scouting. For that reason, the BSA continues to create barriers to abuse
beyond what have previously existed in Scouting.
The Boy Scouts of America places the greatest importance on providing the most secure environment possible
for our youth members. To maintain such an environment, the BSA has developed numerous procedural and
leadership selection policies, and provides parents and leaders with numerous online and print resources for the
Cub Scout, Boy Scout, and Venturing programs.
The BSA requires Youth Protection training for all registered leaders.
New leaders are required to complete Youth Protection training. To take the training online, go to my.Scouting.org
and establish an account using the member number you receive when you register for BSA membership. If you
take the training online before you obtain a member number, be sure to return to MyScouting and enter your
number for training record credit. Your BSA local council also provides training on a regular basis if you cannot
take it online. For more information, refer to the back of the BSA adult membership application, No. 524-501.
Youth Protection training must be taken every two years—regardless of position. If a volunteer does not meet the
BSA’s Youth Protection training requirement at the time of recharter, the volunteer will not be reregistered.
We encourage all adults, including all parents, to take the BSA’s Youth Protection training.
To find out more about the Youth Protection policies of the Boy Scouts of America and how to help Scouting
keep your family safe, see the Parent’s Guide in any of the Cub Scouting or Boy Scouting handbooks, or go to

Introduction to
BSA Aquatics
Section
I





Qualified Supervision: Roles and
Responsibilities of Unit Leaders
All program divisions of the Boy Scouts of America, from Cub Scouting through Venturing, use responsible outdoor
adventure programs to promote character development and values-based leadership training. Activities in and on the
water constitute a large subset of the programs that attract youth to and retain youth in the movement. Millions of youth
participate yearly in aquatics activities during BSA outings under the leadership of more than a million adult volunteers.
The Scouting program is delivered through small local groups led by volunteers and sponsored by local civic clubs,
churches, schools, and other organizations. Those groups, known generically as units, vary in size and name depend-
ing on the age of the youth being served. Units within a geographic division, or district, are assisted by professionals
employed by a council. Individual units often take advantage of council summer camps where trained staff members
assume the responsibility for quality program delivery, but many units also conduct aquatics activities under their own
leadership. Youth camps conducted by other organizations are often standalone programs limited to a short duration
in the summer. BSA camps are simply one element of a year-round unit program. The BSA encourages unit aquatics
initiatives, whether it is a den leader taking advantage of a parent’s offer of a backyard pool, or a crew taking off on its
own Boundary Waters canoe trek from a Northern Tier National High Adventure base camp.
Chapter

4 Chapter 1: Qualified Supervision: Roles and Responsibilities of Unit Leaders
A key to safe, effective unit aquatics activities is informed
and conscientious unit leadership. Serious mishaps during
BSA events are rare. Although various aquatics activities
can involve some degree of risk, those risks are mitigated
by the training and commitment of BSA volunteer leaders.
Properly conducted swimming and boating programs are
safe as well as fun, exciting, and rewarding.
According to BSA guidelines:
All swimming and activity afloat must be super-
vised by a mature and conscientious adult age 21
or older who
• understands and knowingly accepts responsibility
for the well-being and safety of youth members in his
or her care,
• is experienced in the particular activity,
• is confident in his or her ability to respond appropri-
ately in an emergency, and
• is trained and committed to the nine points of
BSA Safety Afloat and/or the eight points of Safe
Swim Defense.
The den leader, Cubmaster, Scoutmaster, or crew Advisor
who accompanies the unit on an outing is always respon-
sible for the first and last bulleted points. However, BSA
policies do not specify that the unit leader must be the one
who satisfies all of the above criteria. Under appropriate
circumstances, the unit leader may delegate responsibil-
ity to others. For example, a Scout troop at a water park
with trained lifeguards on duty need not assign separate
unit personnel to perform water rescue. A Venturing crew
on a whitewater excursion may rely on a licensed outfitter
to provide the necessary equipment and trained guides.
As the above examples demonstrate, a unit can participate
in fun and challenging aquatics activities even if unit
leaders lack the knowledge and skill to conduct the activity
themselves. On the other hand, a troop on its way to a
jamboree need not forgo the use of a hotel pool just
because the facility does not employ a professional
lifeguard, provided unit leaders are properly prepared.
This publication provides the unit leader with information
needed to determine when proper safeguards are in place
for a unit aquatics activity, whether those safeguards are
provided by a facility operator or the unit itself. Basic skills
needed by the unit to function on its own are reviewed, as
well as what to look for in a facility or operator.
After a review of this material, the unit leader should be
confident in his or her ability to judge when an aquatics
activity is safe, when the risk is unacceptable, or when
his or her background is insufficient to make that deter-
mination. Experienced, informed leaders often develop a
sixth sense or intuition with regard to an action. When an
activity exceeds the leader’s comfort zone, it should be
curtailed or modified.


BSA Aquatics: A Wealth of Opportunities
A review of program opportunities is appropriate before discussing how to conduct those activities safely. This information
also provides a basic Scouting background for volunteers whose aquatics training is from other agencies. Probably no other
organization offers its members the range of aquatics pursuits that Scouting offers. Scouting tailors these programs to match
the maturity of the youth in various divisions, from Tigers in the first grade through 20-year-old coed Venturing members.
All aquatics program activities comply with BSA Safe Swim Defense and Safety Afloat standards, which will be covered
extensively in the following chapters. Most of the aquatics activities also require the Scout to pass a basic 100-yard BSA
swimmer classification test. Therefore, teaching the nonswimmer to swim is of primary importance, both for safety and to
give the youth member the opportunity to participate with his/her peers in all aspects of the program.

Cub Scout Aquatics Programs
The basic Cub Scout unit is a den of
six to eight Cub Scouts served by an
adult den leader. Dens are organized
into packs under a Cubmaster. Cub
Scouting is the largest Scouting division
with more than 1.4 million members.
The Cub Scouting program is based on age or school year.
All new members first complete the Bobcat orientation
program. However, a child in the third grade who joins
Scouting begins the program at that stage without
completing the first- and second-grade modules.
Children in the first , second, and third grades work on
Tiger, Wolf, and Bear badges. Cub Scouts in the fourth
and fifth grades undertake more advanced activities
while working on the Webelos and Arrow of Light ranks.
Cub Scouts experience a series of adventures either indi-
vidually with their family or as part of their den. There are
required adventures for each badge plus electives. Each
badge has an elective adventure that focuses on swim-
ming and boating skills and safety.

Immediately after completing an adventure, the Cub Scout
is presented with the appropriate belt loop or pin.
Swimming is an important life skill. Children may be intro-
duced to the water as toddlers, or even younger, but they
don’t become proficient at swimming until later. The early
school years are a good time to teach children to swim,
either individually by a knowledgeable parent or in a group
with a qualified instructor. Since a single set of lessons
typically does not impart the desired water competency,
it is important to continue instruction and closely super-
vised activities until comfort in the water approaches that
of walking. Cub Scouts whose dens consistently choose
the water electives will be well served. Tigers hold their
breath in a prone glide, Wolves swim for 25 feet in shal-
low water, Bears attempt the BSA beginner swimming
classification in deep water, and Webelos attempt the 100-
yard BSA swimmer classification. Basic water safety and
rescues are also progressively addressed.
Den leaders who lack confidence in their ability to con-
duct the water adventures should first review the meet-
ing plans in the den leader guide. Cub Scouts who have
taken Red Cross, YMCA, or other formal swimming les-
sons should already have the basic swimming skills. Den
leaders may also seek guidance from their local council
aquatics committee. That committee may help arrange
learn-to-swim opportunities for dens and may also help
districts incorporate water adventure elements into Cub
Scout day and resident camps. (If your council lacks such
a committee, see Appendix 1.)
Scouts BSA Aquatics Programs
A youth can join a Scouts BSA troop
after completing the fifth grade and
may continue with the program
through age 17. Troops are served by
adult Scoutmasters and are subdivided
into patrols of eight to 10 under youth
leadership. Scouts BSA advance
in rank from Tenderfoot to Eagle Scout. Recognition is
achieved by meeting standards of performance. That is
in contrast to the Cub Scouting program where youth are
rewarded for “doing their best,” or some outside sports
programs with an emphasis on competition. Each Scout
progresses through the ranks in order.
For Scouts BSA, both Second Class and First Class ranks
require demonstration of basic swimming skills and


Chapter 2: BSA Aquatics: A Wealth of Opportunities 7
aquatics safety. Those requirements are found in the
Scouts BSA Handbook. To advance to Eagle Scout rank,
a Scout must know how to swim.
Specialty skills are learned by earning merit badges that also
count toward rank advancement. There are several aquatics
merit badges, described below. Each of those requires the
Scout to first pass the BSA swimmer classification test.
Troops should arrange for basic swimming instruction so
that Scouts are able to meet the Second and First Class rank
requirements and continue with the aquatics merit badges.
Instruction can be done at the troop level by working directly
with individual Scouts or arranging for them to enroll in
various learn-to-swim programs. Some districts offer winter
programs that include basic swimming instruction. All troops
have access to council summer camp programs where basic
swimming instruction is offered and tied to rank requirements
as an incentive.
Merit Badges
Scouts earn merit badges
by working with an approved
counselor registered with the
BSA. Scouts are connected
with counselors through their
Scoutmaster. Adults wishing
to serve as counselors should
review Appendix 2 and
contact a Scoutmaster or the
council office. Pamphlets for
each merit badge list
requirements and performance
standards. Counselors are
expected to present and
evaluate the skills as
specified in those pamphlets.
Counselors are often aware
of alternative or advanced techniques. However, merit
badge material is specifically designed for those of Scout
age and serves as an introduction to a subject requiring
basic skills rather than professional expertise. Merit badge
material is reviewed regularly. Scouts and counselors
should check that they have the most recent pamphlet by
comparing the requirements with those in the Scouts BSA
Requirements booklet published annually. Since special
equipment is required for some of the aquatics merit
badges, Scouts earn many of them when the troop attends
a weeklong summer camp with trained counselors on-site.
However, all merit badges may be earned year-round by a
Scout and a buddy working with a counselor.
The Swimming merit badge, with
more than 73,000 earned each year, is
among the most popular, second only
to First Aid. Requirements include
proficiency in several strokes as well
as associated swimming and safety
skills. Many children learn the basics of swimming at an
early age but stop formal lessons before becoming
proficient in the strokes. The Swimming merit badge
polishes the skills needed for a person to be competent,
and confident, in the water. The Swimming, Hiking, or
Cycling merit badge is required for Eagle Scout rank.
The Lifesaving merit badge teaches
the Scout a progression of water-
rescue techniques. It is one of the few
remaining programs in the United
States that prepares an individual to
deal with the range of emergency
situations likely to be encountered
inadvertently in and around the water.
Some prominent water-safety
organizations offer basic water-
rescue courses to the general public
that stop short of in-water rescues,
which are essential for a victim on the
bottom of a backyard pool. Those
organizations do teach in-water
rescues to lifeguards, but lifeguards
have specific equipment, a known
area, and backup that a lifesaver
happening on a scene may lack. The need for a complete
water-rescue course, even for those of Scout age, is
easily demonstrated. Each year, the BSA awards roughly
a hundred medals to Scouts and Scouters of all ages,
including Cub Scouts, who rescue people from drowning.
Those rescues are reported by active members. Rescues
performed by the millions of former members are not as
easy to track. Many of those performing rescues have not
earned the Lifesaving merit badge, which is one reason
basic water-rescue techniques are discussed throughout
the program rather than only for this specific badge. BSA
members of all ages do encounter situations where their
actions are critical for saving lives. Most children faced
with a friend or sibling in danger will attempt some action.
The BSA strives to give youth the tools needed to make
proper decisions in such circumstances. The BSA also
tracks drownings that occur during Scouting functions.
For decades, there have been no incidents of a Scout
drowning while attempting t o save another. RescuerSMALL-BOAT

safety is a major emphasis of the program. A Scout must
earn either the Lifesaving or the Emergency Preparedness
badge for the Eagle rank. More than 26,000 Lifesaving
merit badges are earned yearly.
The Canoeing merit badge is
designed to provide a Scout with
tandem and solo skills to safely and
efficiently travel on flat water. More
than 33,000 are earned yearly.
The Whitewater merit badge extends
skills learned in earning the Canoeing
badge to cover Class I and Class II
flowing water. The requirements may
be completed using kayaks or rafts as
well as canoes. Because special
equipment, settings, and instruction
are required, this merit badge is not
accessible to as many Scouts, with
just over 3,000 earned yearly.
The Rowing merit badge covers
basic rowing techniques applicable to
conventional and sliding-seat rowing.
Although craft designed and equipped
for rowing are not that common, this
remains a popular merit badge,
particularly at summer camps. More
than 11,000 are earned yearly.
The Small-Boat Sailing merit
badge gives an introduction to basic
sailing techniques and seamanship.
More than 17,000 are earned yearly.
The Motorboating merit badge
covers basic boat handling and safety.
Scouts are not allowed to operate a
motorboat without a counselor on
board and must adhere to state
regulations that sometimes mandate
additional age and skill requirements.
More than 11,000 are earned yearly.
The Water Sports merit badge requires
basic skills in either waterskiing or
wakeboarding, and has replaced the
Waterskiing merit badge. More than
3,000 are earned per year.
The Scuba Diving merit badge requires
the Scout to first earn the Swimming
merit badge and to then obtain Open
Water Diver Certification from a
diver training agency recognized in
Scouting’s policy on scuba. This high-
adventure, environmental awareness program sets the
stage for lifelong recreational and professional pursuits.
More than 6,000 have been earned since the merit badge
was introduced in 2009.
The Kayaking merit badge teaches
basic kayaking skills and safety for
calm water. Those skills support the
very popular use of kayaks for
recreational activities and also serve
as a lead-in to advanced paddle sports
such as sea/touring and whitewater kayaking. It was
introduced in 2012 and rapidly became one of the most
popular outdoor merit badges with 36,000 earned in 2013.
Venturing Programs
Venturing is for young men and
women ages 14 to 20, or 13 with
completion of the eighth grade, and
has nearly 200,000 participants. The
program is focused on four content
areas: adventure, leadership, service,
and personal growth. Leadership of a
Venturing crew is provided by the members under
consultation with adult Advisors. Venturers may earn the
Venturing, Discovery, Pathfinder, and Summit awards.
Crews may undertake various high-adventure treks such
as wilderness canoeing, whitewater rafting, sailboat
cruising, and scuba diving. Aiding them in such efforts is a
network of BSA high-adventure bases.

Sea Scouting
Sea Scouting is a specialized program
for older youth with an emphasis on
boating skills and maritime heritage.
Sea Scout units, called ships, focus
on cruising sailboats or power
vessels. While many ships are near
the coast, others are based on inland
waters. During the boating season,
Sea Scouts learn to maintain and operate their vessel, with a
focus on learning safe and proper handling. Sea Scouts also
learn the meaning of buoys and lights, how to take advantage
of wind and tide, and how to drop anchor or approach a dock.
Most ships hold formal meetings conducted in full dress or
work uniforms. Swimming, lifesaving, first aid, Coast Guard
Auxiliary Sailing and Seamanship, and cardiopulmonary
resuscitation courses are taught by ship youth and adult
leaders. State safe-boating courses are often included in the
program. Members may work on advancement culminating
in the Quartermaster Award. The U.S. Coast Guard provides
a recognition certificate for those who earn that award.
Learn more about Sea Scouting at www.seascout.org.
Special Aquatics Awards
Several BSA aquatics activity awards, not tied to
advancement, promote water safety and are available
to Boy Scouts and Venturers but not Cub Scouts. The
various pieces of support material for each award,
such as cards, patches, and fliers, are listed at the end
of this chapter. Much of the material covering skills
for the awards is presented in this publication, and
application forms are provided in Appendix 3.
In Scouting, the emphasis is on programming for youth.
However, some of these awards promote important skill
and safety information that will help a unit leader conduct
a safe unit activity. Therefore, these awards may also be
earned by unit leaders and other registered volunteers
(collectively known as Scouters). Often, training sessions
are more effective when conducted separately for
different age groups, but in some situations it is more
practical for unit leaders to attend the same training
sessions as unit members. Generally, Scouts should be
given priority over Scouters when equipment is limited.
Mile Swim BSA. This award
promotes physical fitness as well as
confidence. Several training and
conditioning sessions culminate in a
continuous mile-long swim in safe
conditions. The distance can be
covered in a pool or in open water.
Policies for distance swimming in open water are covered
in detail in the Safe Swim Defense discussion in Chapter
6. Although the Mile Swim recognition is designed to
build stamina, anyone who has mastered restful
swimming strokes such as the elementary backstroke,
the sidestroke, or the restful breaststroke should be able
to complete the distance with ease. There is no time limit
for completing the swim.
Snorkeling BSA. This award
encourages the development of basic
skills using a mask, snorkel, and fins.
The requirements must be completed
in clear, confined water. Snorkeling
BSA skills are prerequisites to unit
snorkeling activities in open water.


Chapter 2: BSA Aquatics: A Wealth of Opportunities10
Such activities are covered by Safe Swim Defense and
similar guidelines in BSA Snorkeling Safety, reviewed in
Chapter 11 with a presentation of the skills.
Scuba BSA. In earning this award,
Scouts and Scouters get an
introductory scuba experience in
clear, confined water conducted by
a professionally trained scuba
instructor. Venturing crews may
take part in scuba certification
courses and open-water dives under the guidelines of the
BSA Scuba Policy in Chapter 11.
Kayaking BSA. This award
recognizes the growing interest in
kayaking both in the public and in
Scouting. Kayaking BSA skills in
Chapter 17 satisfy Safety Afloat
training guidelines for kayaking
excursions on calm water.
Boardsailing BSA. This award
was introduced when boardsailing
first became popular and remains a
basic introduction to the sport.
Skills necessary for the award are
discussed in Chapter 24.
BSA Stand Up Paddleboarding.
This award, released to coincide
with SUP programs at the 2013
National Scout Jamboree, provides
basic skill and safety instruction for
stand up paddleboarding in calm
water. Look for requirements online
at www.scouting.org and in Appendix 3 of this manual.
Whitewater Rafting BSA. Many
Scouting units participate in rafting
trips conducted by outfitters or
councils. This award recognizes
the challenge and adventure of
such activities. The award is
available to BSA youth and adults
who are members of Boy Scout, Venturing, or Sea Scout
units. Requirements focus on safety and basic paddling
skills on white water up to Class III. All instruction and
skill completions are directly supervised by a
professionally trained or licensed rafting guide. A
qualified raft captain must be in each raft during the
required trip. Participants help power and control the raft
with paddles—simply riding in a raft rowed by a guide is
not sufficient.


Chapter 2: BSA Aquatics: A Wealth of Opportunities 11
High-Adventure Aquatics Programs
More than 115,000 units are served by nearly 300 local
councils, each of which operates at least one of the more
than 400 organized BSA camping facilities. Almost all of
the council camps offer basic programs in swimming,
lifesaving, rowing, and canoeing. Some include sailing,
kayaking, motorboating, and waterskiing. More than
50 percent of the camps offer units the option of some
type of float trip, on or off council property. Some are
simple overnight trips on flat water; others are weeklong
excursions on flowing water.
The National Council has approved roughly 60 of the
council camps as high-adventure bases with treks lasting
five days or more. While some feature backpacking,
others offer canoeing, kayaking, rafting, or sailing. Some
offer scuba certification or other advanced skills as a
resident program. Most will accept out-of-council troops,
and several accommodate coed crews. A listing of the
camps and their programs can be found at the national
BSA website, www.scouting.org.
The BSA also operates four national high-adventure
programs, several of which offer aquatics programs.
The Northern Tier National
High Adventure Program
(www.ntier.org) stages canoe
treks from three base camps. As
is the model for Scout camping in
general, a troop or crew that
meets year-round comes with its
own adult leadership, although occasionally a council may
recruit a contingent from several units. Northern Tier
normally provides a trained staff member to accompany
inexperienced groups, but experienced units may elect to
travel without guidance. Each summer, roughly 5,000
Scouts in groups of six to 11 take wilderness canoe trips
lasting six to 10 days.
The Charles L. Sommers base camp near Ely, Minnesota,
has been the starting point for trips into the Boundary
Waters Canoe Area Wilderness since 1923. The camp
operates a radio base station that forms an important
part of the emergency response system for the area.
Commercial outfitters often instruct their customers to
contact a BSA crew in case of emergency. The Rogert
base camp near Atikokan, Ontario, accesses Quetico
Provincial Park from the Canadian side. A base camp in
Bissett, Manitoba, stages treks into Atikaki Park via float
plane to Scout Lake.
The Florida National High
Adventure Sea Base
(www.bsaseabase.org)
began operations in the
1970s and now runs two
staging areas in the Florida
Keys. The sea base operates
one of the largest scuba
programs in the United
States with roughly 1,500 participants yearly. While many
participants seek scuba certification, those already
certified may dive from boats stationed at the base or
from live-aboard sailboats. Another 9,000 or so engage in


Chapter 2: BSA Aquatics: A Wealth of Opportunities12
various boating activities. Some kayak to a 110-acre
island owned by the base and camp Robinson Crusoe–
style. Others sail the Keys and the Bahamas on
live-aboard vessels.
The newest BSA
national facility is
the Summit Bechtel
Family National Scout Reserve in West Virginia. The
Summit site includes the Paul R. Christen High Adventure
Base and the James C. Justice National Scout Camp. The
Summit is not limited to aquatics: It has world-class
climbing, canopy tours, mountain biking, and other high-
adventure activities. However, it is adjacent to the New
River Gorge National River managed by the U.S. National
Park Service. Because the New River Gorge is home to
some of the world’s best white water, whitewater
programs are central experiences at the Summit.
Although Scouting offers units many exciting opportunities
for high-adventure treks, units are not restricted to
using only BSA facilities. Some units “go it alone” on
yearly journeys down a local river. Others contract
with commercial outfitters for equipment, supplies, and
guides. The Northern Tier handles roughly half of the
Scouting units traveling to the Boundary Waters each
year, according to estimates. So long as Safe Swim
Defense and Safety Afloat guidelines are followed by
conscientious, trained leaders, units are encouraged to
provide youth with exciting, challenging, age-appropriate
opportunities for growth and leadership development.
National Jamborees
Every four years the National
Council sponsors a national
jamboree to which local councils
send contingents totaling roughly
40,000 for a 10-day encampment. In
2013, the Summit was designated as
the permanent site for the National
Scout Jamboree. Initial jamboree
aquatics programs at the Summit included whitewater
rafting, dragon boating, paddleboarding, kayaking,
introductory scuba, and a water challenge course. Those
programs will change as facilities are developed and
interests evolve. The Summit will also host the 24th World
Jamboree in 2019.
Training Programs for Adults
(and Older Youth)
Such diverse and extensive aquatics programs mean the
BSA must recruit and/or train volunteers to provide the
program at the unit level, as well as professionals, full-time
and seasonal, to assist units via camp operations. Several
training options are available to registered adults and older
youth to meet unit and summer camp staff needs.


Chapter 2: BSA Aquatics: A Wealth of Opportunities 13
Safe Swim Defense and Safety Afloat
Commitment Training
Basic training introduces Safe Swim Defense and Safety
Afloat procedures. The plans emphasize prevention but
also cover emergency recognition and response. Such
training is required whenever a unit goes swimming
or boating. Awareness training for these policies may
be provided by lectures or videos at various training
events. Introductory training is also available at
my.scouting.org. Unit leaders who attend summer camps
are provided opportunities to practice the procedures
with staff assistance.
Safe Swim Defense and Safety Afloat
Skills Training
A simple introduction to rules
and procedures should allow a
conscientious leader to assess
his/her readiness to conduct a
unit aquatics activity. However,
the policies suggest or mandate
various skills that cannot be
learned in a lecture or online.
To fill that gap are two hands-on
courses that provide the unit
leader with basic skills. Aquatics
Supervision: Swimming and
Water Rescue and Aquatics Supervision: Paddle Craft
Safety provide in-depth training in Safe Swim Defense
and Safety Afloat principles along with basic swimming,
boating, and rescue skills. Situations requiring more
advanced skills are reviewed, with sources for such
training. These courses are highly recommended
for unit leaders whenever a unit swims at a location
without professional lifeguards or undertakes a boating
expedition without a trained guide. This publication
serves as the manual for the two courses. Requirements
are given in Appendix 3. The courses are taught by
authorized instructors following standardized guidelines.
BSA Lifeguard
For three-quarters of a century,
BSA Lifeguard and its
predecessor, Scout Lifeguard,
served the needs of units and
summer camps for water safety
leadership training. Over that
time, more and more programs
requiring specialized skills, such as snorkeling and
kayaking, have been added. The skills that define the
standard of care for summer camp operations, such as
spinal injury management, have also evolved. Those
changes made it increasingly difficult to meet all the
needs in a single course of reasonable duration.
Therefore, the emphasis of BSA Lifeguard has changed.
The primary purpose is no longer to give units the skills
necessary to conduct safe swimming and boating
activities. The two Aquatics Supervision awards in
Swimming and Water Rescue and Paddle Craft Safety are
designed to meet that need. The revised BSA Lifeguard
program now focuses on the need to provide BSA-
operated facilities, such as summer camps, with training
that meets the requirements of government agencies for
professional lifeguards at regulated swimming activities.
The program is open to all registered adults and older
youth and is a recommended adjunct to the Aquatics
Supervision awards for unit leaders who wish to expand
their water safety skills and for youth who wish to work
on the aquatics staffs at BSA camps.
BSA Aquatics Instructor
BSA Aquatics Instructor is the
highest level of training,
achievement, and recognition
for adults in Scouting aquatics.
The training prepares adults for
leadership roles in year-round
aquatics programs and in
summer camps. Topics include
a review of the goals, requirements, policies, and
procedures for all Scouting aquatics programs; basic skill
review in swimming, lifesaving, and boating; how to teach
those skills to participants of various ages; and how to
manage the aquatics program at a BSA Cub Scout or Boy
Scout camp facility. The training is offered only in
conjunction with a BSA National Camping School. BSA
regional offices typically conduct National Camping

School sessions in the early spring. Participants must be
approved by their local council.
National BSA camp standards require that aquatics
directors at BSA camps are 21 years of age or older, have
current CPR and first-aid training, and have current BSA
Aquatics Instructor training. However, BSA Aquatics
Instructor training is available to those 18 or older.
Councils are encouraged to send aquatics staff members
who are below 21 years of age for Aquatics Instructor
training to serve as assistant aquatics directors and to gain
experience before becoming a camp aquatics director.
Such a succession plan also makes it easier for councils to
manage staffing needs.
Links to Other Organizations
The BSA recognizes that other organizations provide
expertise in specialized activities such as waterskiing
and works with those organizations to keep BSA aquatics
programs up-to-date. In particular, the BSA National
Council has agreements or understandings with the
American Red Cross, the Professional Association of
Diving Instructors, the American Canoe Association, the
United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, and United States
Power Squadrons. Training provided by other organizations
extends the base of volunteers with the necessary
background to offer quality BSA programs. However,
BSA programs are not simply copies of programs offered
by other agencies. In areas such as Safe Swim Defense,
the BSA is a recognized leader in the field. In other areas,
such as scuba training, an instructor rating from an
outside agency is required to offer the BSA programs.
In that case, the BSA program may be more limited than
similar programs offered by the instructor’s certifying
agency. Therefore, outside instructors need to become
familiar with specific BSA policies and requirements
before conducting activities for Scouts. This publication
provides a useful overview, but activity-specific literature,
such as merit badge pamphlets, should also be consulted.
Also note that each merit badge pamphlet solicits
suggestions for improvement and provides an address for
sending comments.

Council Aquatics Committees
Few units have the resources to independently provide all of
the programs listed above. Councils can give units additional
opportunities by establishing a council aquatics committee
to foster local programs, provide training, help recruit camp
aquatics staff, and oversee council resources, such as
establishing policies for units to use council canoes when
camp is not in session. Additional information on aquatics
committees is found in Appendix 1. A major goal of every
Baden-Powell’s Outlook on
Swimming and the First Class Scout
“A boy does not really get the value of the Scout training until he is a First Class Scout.
The Second Class rank is only a step to that standing. But it is a lamentable fact that
a good many are content to remain as Second Class Scouts once they have gained
a few badges of proficiency. It is primarily for that reason mainly, that the All Round
Cords are now obtainable only by First Class Scouts. This move has been welcomed
by Scoutmasters as giving an incentive to the lads to keep progressing in their training.
“Of course, the main objection to it is that it necessitates the boys learning to swim, and
facilities for this do not exist in all centers. It has, therefore, been suggested in one or two
cases that this rule should be relaxed. I am afraid that I have been very ‘sticky’ about it, and although I generally make
things as elastic as possible, I may have appeared unnaturally obstinate in this one particular: but I had reasons, and
experience has now shown those reasons were right.
“When a boy has become a First Class Scout—but not before then—he has got a founding in the qualities—mental,
moral and physical—that go with making a good, useful man. And I look on swimming as a very important step,
combining as it does attributes of all three of those classes. Mentally, it gives the boy a new sense of self-confidence
and pluck; morally, it gives him the power of helping others in distress and puts a responsibility upon him of actually
risking his life at any moment for others; and physically, it is a grand exercise for developing wind and limb.
“Every man ought to be able to swim; and in Norway and Sweden, the home of practical education, every boy and girl
is taught swimming at school.
“The fact that swimming has got to be learned by the Boy Scout before he can gain his First Class badge has had the
effect of putting the character of the lads in very many cases to a hard and strengthening test.
“At first they complained that there was no place near where they could learn to swim. But when they found this was
not accepted as an excuse, they set to work to make places or to get to where such places existed. I have heard of
boys riding five miles on their bicycles day after day to swimming baths; streams in many country places have been
dammed up, and bathing places made by the Scouts; the summer camp has been established at some seaside or
riverside spot for the special purpose of getting everyone trained in swimming.
“It can be done if everybody sets his mind to it. If the boys are put to extra trouble in bringing it about, so much the
better for their character training. In any case, I look upon swimming as an essential qualification for First Class
Scout, and for every man. Also, I don’t consider a boy a real Scout till he has passed his First Class tests.”
—Lord Baden-Powell, February 1914

Scouting has both the opportunity and the encouragement to
learn how to swim.

Safety First
Simple tasks can become risky if basic safety precautions are ignored, and apparently dangerous activities can be
done with minimal risk with proper planning and safeguards. For any activity, several items foster safety. A review
of common causes of accidents is a good place to start. With that knowledge, rules and procedures can then be
established to avoid risky situations. Prevention is the first and most important safety consideration. Key components
for prevention include the health and skill of participants, the safety of equipment and the environment, and the
observance of rules and procedures (supervision and discipline).
Contingency plans are important in case an emergency does arise. Prompt recognition of a developing crisis is a
nontrivial task that requires conscientious effort and a plan for adequate surveillance of everyone in the activity.
The buddy system is used in Scouting to provide one-on-one observation to augment the scrutiny provided by the
unit leader and rescue personnel. Appropriate response to an emergency is easier when a prearranged emergency
action plan is implemented by those trained in relevant rescue skills.
Chapter

Chapter 3: Safety First20
The rest of this section will review common causes of
drowning, introduce the basic elements of Safe Swim
Defense and Safety Afloat procedures for drowning
prevention, and outline the general elements of an
emergency action plan for swimming and boating activities.
The text will expand on rules and procedures, surveillance,
emergency action plans, and rescue skills for specific
activities at various sites. Should an emergency arise, water
rescue is relatively safe and simple when care is taken to
operate in a safe setting with appropriate rescue aids at
hand. Even so, situations in which rescue skills are needed
should be extremely rare. The overall safety of an aquatics
activity or facility should be judged by the absence of
crisis and rescue. If rescues are commonplace, inadequate
precautions have been taken to ensure the highest safety
standards, even if all the rescues are successful.
Millions of Scouts and millions more in the general public
enjoy water sports year-round without any adverse
experience. Water and people mix well when simple
precautions are taken. However, not everyone realizes
the need for such precautions. Each year, several
thousand people drown in the United States. Thousands
more are taken to emergency rooms due to water-related
incidents, and not all of those people completely recover.
Thousands of others are saved from injury by alert
lifeguards or other rescuers.
“Drowning is an unlovely thing.”
—Wilbert Longfellow,
early BSA water safety consultant
Two unfortunate tragedies dramatically illustrate how the
public at large sometimes underestimates the danger in a
seemingly benign situation.
A mother arranged to chaperone a group of teenaged
girls at an overnight stay at a hotel as a treat for her
daughter’s birthday. While the group was using the hotel
pool, the daughter, who could not swim, moved into water
over her head. The mother noticed the daughter acting
strangely and jumped into the water when the daughter
did not respond to her calls. The mother, as her feet hit the
bottom, managed to push her daughter a short distance
to the side, where the other girls helped her out. With all
their attention focused on the daughter, no one noticed
that the mother, who also could not swim, could not move
herself the short distance to safety. The mother drowned,
unable to call for help.
Two well-meaning and conscientious adults took a
newly formed youth group on an overnight campout. The
campsite was near a small, slow-moving river, and the
group waded into the water from a shallow sandbar. Two
boys, who could not swim, stepped off the sandbar into
the channel where the water was over their heads. They
did not call out for help, submerged, and drowned without
anyone realizing they were in peril.
Both incidents illustrate the “instinctive drowning
response” first publicized by Frank Pia in the 1970s. True
nonswimmers—that is, those who have never supported
themselves in deep water—are often in danger as soon
as they enter deep water. Such persons, from toddlers
through adults, are unable to call for help and unable to
move even a few feet to safety, whether safety is a pool
side, the other side of a drop-off, or a flotation device they
fell from. To an uninformed observer, such victims may
even appear to be playing in the water.
Drowning in Perspective
• Nonswimmers are at risk in and near deep water; for
example, floating on an air mattress.
• Drowning follows car accidents as the second leading
cause of accidental death for Scout-aged youth.
• Males comprise roughly three-fourths of drowning victims.
• Drowning happens more often in warm-weather months.
• In some warm-weather states, deaths from drowning
for 1- to 4-year-olds match those from car accidents.
• Most drownings of those ages 1 to 4 occur in
residential pools.
• Relatively few drownings occur in pools where
lifeguards are on duty. (Failure of the guard to notice
the victim is a contributing factor in those cases.)


Chapter 3: Safety First 21
• Headfirst entry into the water contributes to
sports-related spinal injuries.
• Many victims did not intend to enter the water.
Drowning can result from falls, boating accidents,
and cars entering the water.
• Floods are second only to fire as the most common
natural disasters. Drowning is the main cause of
flood-related deaths.
• Boating activities account for roughly one-fourth of
all drownings.
• Most boating fatalities occur in small, open motorboats
on inland waters due to capsize or falling overboard.
• Life jackets are not worn in more than 80 percent of
fatal boating accidents.
• Alcohol is estimated as a contributing factor in
25 percent to 50 percent of swimming and
boating fatalities.
• Cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 cause of death in
the United States. Survival rates are affected when
heart attacks and strokes occur in or on the water.
Drowning by the Numbers
Most deaths in the United States are from disease;
however, for youth of Scouting age, deaths from injuries
exceed those from disease. Also note that teenage
suicide accounts for more deaths for that age group than
any accidental cause other than vehicular accidents.

(Note that the CDC reports drowning from
boating and other vehicular accidents separately
from swimming incidents.)
Even though the percentage of deaths due to drowning
may be small, the hundreds of easily preventable
deaths demonstrate the need for increased water-
safety awareness.
Such statistics can be combined with case studies to
support the following reasons people drown. When one
or more of these contributing causes of drowning are
present, tragedy can result. Lack of attention to any
one factor may result in inadequate regard for others.
Fortunately, informed leadership can easily implement
procedures to minimize the risk from each factor.


Chapter 3: Safety First22
“Every Scout a swimmer” was an early slogan of the
Boy Scouts of America. No other factor contributes
more to the safety of an individual in the water than
the ability to easily move through it. Unit leaders
today should strive to meet the 1924 goal.
• Poor swimming skills. Many people who drown
lack the skill to swim only a few feet to safety.
Knowing how to swim is the best protection against
drowning. Although poor swimmers can safely
participate in shallow-water or near-shore activities,
a conscientious BSA leader will encourage everyone
in the unit to advance at least to the BSA “swimmer”
level. Exhaustion is often cited as a factor in drownings
when a poor swimmer overestimates his or her
swimming ability. A swimmer who has learned restful
swimming strokes seldom has that problem.
• Medical complications. Drowning can result
when strokes, heart attacks, diabetic reactions, or
seizures occur in the water. Such conditions can cause
an otherwise good swimmer to become incapacitated.
Prevention relies on medical screening. Supervisors
should review the health histories of all participants and
physicians’ recommendations. Special precautions may
be needed for those with certain medical conditions.
• Unsafe areas. Unsafe situations for swimming and
boating include swift water, submerged obstacles,
ocean rip currents, high waves, and cold water.
Even a simple drop-off is unsafe for a nonswimmer,
which means extra precautions are needed for poor
swimmers engaged in water sports. Although it is
often possible to determine that an area is unsafe
simply by looking, confirming that an area is safe may
take an underwater search of a swimming area or
advanced scouting of a river.
• Poor judgment. Often, the skill of those taking
part determines how safe an area or activity is.
Participation in an unsafe activity reflects a lack
of knowledge or judgment. Examples include
overestimating swimming or boating skill, failing
to wear a life jacket, diving into shallow water, and
alcohol or other drug abuse. Education is one key to
prevention. Rule enforcement is another.
• Inadequate supervision. A toddler left unattended
near a pool is an example of inadequate supervision.
Allowing youth groups to engage in unsafe activities
is another. Qualified supervision and discipline
provide protection.
Accident Prevention: Elements of
Safe Swim Defense and Safety Afloat
Each of the above factors contributing to drowning is
specifically covered by elements of the BSA Safe Swim
Defense and Safety Afloat plans. The primary emphasis
of each plan is prevention. Qualified supervision and
discipline guard against unsafe activities and ensure that
each point is properly implemented. A personal health
review addresses medical complications. Ability groups,
swimming ability, and skill proficiency match activities,
areas, and equipment to abilities. Safe swimming area,
equipment, including life jackets, and planning concern
safe physical arrangements.
Each plan covers preparation, including recognition and
response, should an accident occur. The buddy system,
lookouts, and response personnel provide eyes and
ears alert for trouble and ensure that someone is available
to provide safe and effective assistance. They are integral
parts of emergency action plans.
Safe Swim Defense and Safety Afloat are the backbones
of safe unit swimming and boating activities. They define
standard operating procedures for BSA water sports
and the standard of care expected of unit leadership.
The points are introduced here to show their close
relationship to factors that lead to drowning. However, a
simple listing does not provide sufficient information to
actually implement the procedures. Each item will be fully
explained in subsequent discussions.


Chapter 3: Safety First 23
1. Qualified Supervision.
All swimming activity must be
supervised by a mature and
conscientious adult 21 or older
who understands and knowingly
accepts responsibility for the well-
being and safety of those in his or
her care, and who is trained in and
committed to the eight points of
BSA Safe Swim Defense.
2. Personal Health Review.
Require evidence of fitness for
swimming activity with a complete
health history from a physician,
parent, or legal guardian. The
adult supervisor should adjust
all supervision, discipline, and
protection to anticipate any
potential risks associated with
individual health conditions. In
the event of any significant health
conditions, an examination by a
physician should be required by
the adult supervisor.
3. Safe Area.
All swimming areas must be
carefully inspected and prepared
for safety prior to each activity.
Water depth, quality, temperature,
movement, and clarity are
important considerations. Hazards
must be eliminated or isolated
by conspicuous markings and
discussed with participants.
4. Response Personnel
(Lifeguards).
Every swimming activity must
be closely and continuously
monitored by a trained rescue
team on the alert for and ready to
respond during emergencies.
5. Lookout.
The lookout continuously monitors
the conduct of the swim, identifies
any departures from Safe
Swim Defense, alerts response
personnel as needed, and monitors
the weather and environment.
6. Ability Groups.
All participants are designated
as swimmers, beginners, or
nonswimmers based on swimming
ability confirmed by standardized
BSA swim classification tests.
Each group is assigned a specific
swimming area with depths
consistent with those abilities.
7. Buddy System.
Every participant is paired with
one other. Buddies stay together,
monitor each other, and alert
the safety team if either needs
assistance or is missing.
8. Discipline.
Rules are effective only when
followed. All participants should
know, understand, and respect
the rules and procedures for safe
swimming provided by Safe Swim
Defense guidelines. Applicable
rules should be discussed prior
to the outing and reviewed for
all participants at the water’s
edge just before the swimming
activity begins.
Summary of Safe Swim Defense Guidelines


Chapter 3: Safety First24
Summary of Safety Afloat Guidelines
1. Qualified Supervision.
All activity afloat must be supervised by
a mature and conscientious adult 21 or
older who understands and knowingly
accepts responsibility for the well-being
and safety of those in his or her care,
and who is trained in and committed to
the nine points of BSA Safety Afloat.
2. Personal Health Review.
All participants must present evidence
of fitness by a complete health history
from a physician, parent, or legal
guardian. Adjust all supervision,
discipline, and protection to anticipate
any risks associated with individual
health conditions. In the event of any
significant health conditions, a medical
evaluation by a physician should be
required by the adult leader.
3. Swimming Ability.
Operation of any boat on a float trip is
limited to youth and adults who have
completed the standard BSA swimmer
classification test. (Beginners and
nonswimmers may participate in
activities afloat only with the approval of
the qualified supervisor in compliance
with the complete text of Safety Afloat.)
4. Life Jackets.
Properly fitted U.S. Coast Guard–
approved life jackets must be worn by
all persons engaged in boating activity.
Type III life jackets are recommended
for general recreational use.
5. Buddy System.
All participants are paired as buddies
who are always aware of each other’s
situation and prepared to sound an
alarm and lend assistance immediately
when needed. Buddies either ride in
the same boat or stay near one another
in single-person craft.
6. Skill Proficiency.
Everyone in an activity afloat must
have sufficient knowledge and skill to
participate safely. (Skills appropriate for
different situations are summarized in
the complete text of Safety Afloat and
reviewed elsewhere in this publication.)
7. Planning.
Proper planning is necessary to
ensure a safe, enjoyable exercise
afloat. All plans should include a
scheduled itinerary, notification of
appropriate parties, communication
arrangements, contingencies in case
of foul weather or equipment failure,
and emergency response options.
8. Equipment.
All craft must be suitable for the activity,
seaworthy, and capable of floating if
capsized. All craft and equipment must
meet regulatory standards, be properly
sized, and be in good repair. Spares,
repair materials, and emergency gear
must be carried as appropriate.
9. Discipline.
All participants should know,
understand, and respect the rules and
procedures for safe boating activities
provided by Safety Afloat guidelines.
Applicable rules should be discussed
prior to the outing and reviewed for all
participants at the water’s edge just
before the activity begins.


Chapter 3: Safety First 25
Risk Management
Safe Swim Defense and Safety Afloat guidelines give the
conscientious unit leader tools to prevent emergencies
specific to aquatics activities. In effect, they are well-
established risk management guidelines, which, if
followed, should reassure the unit leader that the group
is prepared for safe enjoyment of the aquatic world.
To some degree, the extent to which Safe Swim Defense
and Safety Afloat guidelines manage risk depends on the
willingness of each person in the group to take an active
role. Scouting encourages youth to take responsibility for
their behavior and safety. Ideally, each participant should
feel concern and accountability for the safety of his or
her buddy. A leader who empowers group members with
resources, training, and responsibilities will often find
that they can be trusted to do their own part to manage
risks. If Scouts understand the rationale behind each
point of Safety Afloat and Safe Swim Defense, they are
more likely to comply.
An injury that doesn’t
happen needs no treatment.
An emergency that doesn’t
occur requires no response.
—Chapter 11, “Emergency Preparedness,”
in the 2014 BSA Fieldbook.
However, the ultimate responsibility for risk management
rests with the adult leader. Tigers can easily become
caught in the excitement of a moment, completely forget
the rules, and become oblivious to their surroundings,
without being at all intentionally disrespectful or
irresponsible. Teenagers are generally more aware of
circumstances about them, but the teen brain is still in
development and may not perceive risk the same as an
adult mind. Part of risk management on any youth outing
is understanding how to guide youth of a certain age
toward desired behaviors. A list of rules will not instill
that capability. However, the leader who has that skill can
apply it to unfamiliar activities. As an aid, the chart at the
end of Chapter 2 presents age-appropriate guidelines for
aquatics activities.
A leader’s responsibilities seldom
begin and end when a Scout
enters and exits a swimming
area. Swimming and boating
are normally components of a
unit outing, whether part of a
den meeting or an extended
wilderness trip by a Venturing
crew. As an aquatics event
moves farther from an emergency
medical service (EMS) system
and Scouts become dependent
on the food and gear they carry into the backcountry, the
unit leader needs to consider risk management of situations
that will not be covered in this text, such as shelter, food
preparation, sanitation, and dangerous wildlife. Other training
materials provided by the BSA should fill those gaps. The
Fieldbook quoted at left is a good place to begin for outdoor
adventure planning.
Although risks can be managed, they are seldom completely
eliminated. Therefore, the prepared leader always has an
emergency response plan and the skills and materials to
implement it. Preparedness requires preparation. The next
section will introduce generic components of emergency
response plans, and other sections will provide details
specific to swimming and boating.
However, the text may not cover some fundamental items,
such as first aid skills, that apply to all unit activities
whether in the water or on dry land. It is highly
recommended that an adult is present at all unit gatherings
who is trained in standard first aid and CPR.
In urban settings, unit leaders should
know the approximate response time
and how to contact emergency
medical services. For backcountry
trips, where communication is
more difficult and response delayed,
leaders may wish to consider
courses in American Red
Cross Wilderness First
Aid and Wilderness
First Responder.


Chapter 3: Safety First26
Emergency Response Plans
In 1908, Baden-Powell, founder of the Scouting movement,
offered the following observation on being prepared for
an accident:
Be prepared to do that thing the moment the accident
does occur. I will explain to you what ought to be done
in the different kinds of accidents, and you must practice
them as much as possible. But, the great thing for you
Scouts to bear in mind is that wherever you are, and
whatever you are doing, you should think to yourself:
“What accident is likely to occur here?” and “What is
my duty if it does?”
That statement is still excellent advice for anyone
charged with supervising an activity. The first sentence
means you have planned for emergencies. The second
suggests you are trained in how to respond and that
you keep your skills current through practice. The third
means you are conscientious and continually on the
alert. Perhaps you become a little on edge about how
you and your group would respond to the scenarios you
are running through your mind as conditions change and
the activity progresses. If you aren’t comfortable with the
answers to the questions, you take immediate steps to
reduce risk and improve preparedness.
Skilled planners “live” the experience in advance by
thinking their way through every detail of an activity
and likely emergency situation. Key skills, such as
rescue techniques, are practiced. Equipment is tested;
for example, you check that a cell phone has a signal.
Drills are conducted to ensure that everyone in the unit
understands their responsibility. Such preparation helps
eliminate surprises. If an emergency occurs, uncertainty,
confusion, and panic are replaced by self-confidence
and prompt and appropriate action.
Emergencies confronting a unit leader during a unit swim
or trip afloat may be either major or minor. Generally,
minor emergencies are more likely but easier to deal with.
Minor emergencies during aquatics activities include
simple first aid cases, misuse of equipment, scuffles,
approaching inclement weather, and capsize in calm,
warm water. Major emergencies include cardiac arrest,
spinal injury, drowning, and boaters pinned by current.
Major emergencies, though rare, require additional
planning. Keys to proper response are foresight,
recognition, coordination, and practice.
Emergency action plans should exist for all BSA activities,
not just aquatics. They are not always long and complicated,
even for major emergencies. For a backyard swim, they
may be very simple and require only a short discussion or
review just before the activity. For a heart attack, a trained
adult starts CPR while another dials 9-1-1. For a spinal injury,
a trained adult provides in-line stabilization and waits in the
water for paramedics to arrive. Emergency action plans for
those or other life-threatening emergencies on a wilderness
canoe trip will require more extensive planning and
coordination. Plans should be reviewed with all the adults
and senior youth leaders on the trip, and some items may
need practice before the outing.
The first step in formulating an emergency action plan
is to assess the various risks that should be covered.
Some items, such as a small cut or a superficial burn, can
be grouped together under a general first aid heading.
Serious emergencies will generally share a common
communication procedure and evacuation plan. Some
situations, such as what to do if someone is caught in a
hydraulic, may stand alone.
Each plan should address the following basics:
• When and how the plan is activated
• Who takes charge of the overall response
• Who conducts the rescue or provides aid to the victim
• What equipment will be needed, and where it is
• Communication between victim and rescuer
• Communication with and supervision of the rest of
the unit members, who may assist with the effort or
need to be removed from danger
• Who summons EMS, law enforcement, or other
authorities, under what circumstances, and how
• After the victim is stabilized or removed from
immediate danger, what follow-up care is needed,
including (if necessary) how to evacuate the victim
or the entire unit
Details will be provided in subsequent discussions of
specific activities and locations. There is one additional
item to be discussed here:
• Notification of parents and council office as appropriate
Whenever a person loses consciousness or needs
medical care beyond simple first aid, such as transport
by EMS to a hospital emergency room, leaders should


Chapter 3: Safety First 27
immediately notify the parent or other person designated
in advance as an emergency contact. The emergency
action plan should include such a contact list.
In case of a missing person, serious injury, or fatality, unit
leaders are responsible for informing their council office
as soon as possible. The Scout executive or designee will
provide trained help with notification of next of kin, dealing
with the press, and counseling for others in the unit.
Youth Protection
The Boy Scouts of America places the greatest importance
on creating the most secure environment possible for our
youth members. To maintain such an environment, the BSA
developed numerous procedural and leadership selection
policies and provides parents and leaders with resources
for the Cub Scout, Boy Scout, and Venturing programs.
The BSA takes great pride in the quality of our adult
leadership. Being a leader in the BSA is a privilege, not
a right. We work closely with our chartered organizations
to help recruit the best possible leaders for their units.
The BSA has implemented mandatory Youth Protection
training for all registered volunteers. New leaders are
required to complete Youth Protection training within 30
days of registering.
The adult application requests background information that
should be checked by the unit committee or the chartered
organization before accepting an applicant for unit leadership.
Please visit www.scouting.org/YouthProtection for Scouting’s
Barriers to Abuse and other important resources.
Two registered adult leaders or one registered
leader and a parent of a participant, or other
adult, one of whom must be 21 years of age or
older, are required on all trips and outings. All
registered adults must have completed Youth
Protection training.
Therefore, even though Safe Swim Defense or other
aquatics policies may designate that only one trained adult
is needed to supervise the activity, it is assumed that at
least one other responsible adult, who may not be trained
in water safety, is available to assist with implementing an
emergency action plan.
The Youth Protection policies of the BSA also address
privacy and appropriate attire. Adult leaders must protect
their own privacy and respect the privacy of youth
members in situations such as changing into swimsuits,
whether in a changing room at a public water park or at
a remote campsite. Neither skinny-dipping nor revealing
bathing suits are appropriate as part of Scouting.
Additional information on Youth Protection and
transportation is found in these publications.
Transportation
Since traffic accidents are the primary cause of accidental
death in the United States, with the number of fatalities far
exceeding those from drowning, unit members may be more
at risk traveling to an aquatics area than when engaged
in the activity. The BSA has established transportation
policies and guidelines to minimize such risk. The complete
policies are in the Guide to Safe Scouting and should be
reviewed before the unit goes on an outing. By way of
review, recall that:
• Transport by commercial carriers, such as chartered
buses, is recommended, particularly for large groups.
• Except in special circumstances, all drivers must be at
least 18 years of age with a valid license for the type
of vehicle in use, and must observe traffic regulations,
including speed limits.
• All occupants of cars, vans, and trucks must wear
seat belts.
• Driving time is limited to a maximum of 10 hours per
day and must be interrupted by frequent rest, food,
and recreation stops.


Chapter 3: Safety First28
• Fatigue is a major cause of highway accidents. Don’t
drive while drowsy.
• All driving, except for short trips, should be done
in daylight.
Highway transport of boats, by trailer or on roof carriers,
requires special consideration and will be discussed
further in sections on various craft.
Tour and Activity Plans
There is no national policy that requires units to file a formal
tour plan with local councils. However, informed planning at
the unit level is a practical concept that fosters successful,
safe activities and is recognized as such in the BSA Safety
Afloat policy.
Legal Considerations
A leader’s moral obligation to protect the youth under
his or her supervision should overshadow any concerns
about legal accountability. Nevertheless, some
volunteers may have concerns about legal exposure
should something happen despite their diligent efforts.
The best way to avoid litigation is to prevent physical or
mental trauma through safety awareness, preparation,
consistent application of policies, and other tools of risk
management. The material reviewed here is presented as
an additional aid to ensure preparedness, not as a reason
to forego the pleasure, challenges, and satisfaction that
arise from participating in aquatics activities.
Most legal actions that result from an accident during
a supervised youth activity are civil: an injured party,
or plaintiff, charges a person or organization, the
defendant, with responsibility for the accident. Legal
responsibility, or liability, is the issue, and the court may
award compensation for both actual damages and as
punishment (a punitive award). In a criminal case, the
government charges the defendant with violating a law.
The issue is guilt, which if proved, causes the court to
impose punishment.
Although civil suits may be initiated under a wide variety of
circumstances, the plaintiff generally must establish that
harm has resulted from negligence, or the failure to act
properly. Negligence need not be intentional or willful. It
arises when the defendant fails to act appropriately, or
acts improperly. Negligence can result from carelessness,
poor judgment, forgetfulness, inexperience, ignorance, or
failure to notice and/or correct a hazardous situation.
To establish negligence, the plaintiff must first show that
the defendant had a duty to act. A duty to act, or duty
of care, is established when a person or organization
accepts responsibility for the safety of another. A
parent has a duty to a child. In loco parentis means
that another person has temporarily assumed a parent’s
responsibility. A person who invites a neighbor’s child to
play in a backyard wading pool has a duty of care, as does
a Scoutmaster supervising a troop swim on a campout.
After a court determines that a duty of care exists, the
next step is to determine the standard of care that
applies to that duty. The parent watching neighborhood
children in a wading pool may only be required to act
as a “reasonable” or “prudent” person would under
the circumstances. A bystander applying first aid at an
accident scene is generally held to a lesser standard of
care than an on-duty emergency room physician. Lay
persons are often afforded some legal protection by Good
Samaritan laws, so long as they act in accord with and
within the limits of any training they have received. Note
that the standard of care expected of a volunteer leader
may be modified by the training and policies imposed by
a sponsoring organization. For example, a plaintiff may
establish negligence by showing that the actions of a
Scout leader were not in accord with BSA policy or that
they were inconsistent with how similarly trained persons
would have acted.
Failure to perform the duty of care to the appropriate
standard is called a breach. A breach by itself does not
constitute negligence. Harm or damage has to result from
the breach.
The following examples, some of which may fit in more
than one category, may support a claim of negligence.
Numerous other examples can be constructed simply by
taking the inverse of any previously stated safety policy.
Failure to provide a safe environment:
• No boundary line is used between deep water and
the nonswimmer area.
• Youth are provided with adult-sized life jackets.
• A tripping hazard exists where sections of a floating
dock are attached.


Chapter 3: Safety First 29
Improper action:
• The unit leader leaves swimmers unattended.
• A youth is pressured to attempt a skill he is
uncomfortable doing.
• Dangerous actions are encouraged, such as racing
starts in shallow water or running a low-head dam.
Lack of action:
• First aid is not provided, or is stopped too soon.
• Rapids are not scouted.
• Rules are not enforced, or are enforced
inconsistently.
According to respondent superior doctrine, an
organization or employer can be held responsible for the
negligence of a volunteer or employee. The Scoutmaster,
the local council, and the National Council may all be
named in a suit that originates from the actions of an
assistant leader. While the attorneys representing the
plaintiff may prefer to go after the “deep pockets” that
can afford both the legal fees and the care due an injured
party, lack of personal wealth does not protect any
defendant from the wrath of an aggrieved parent and the
indignation of a jury. Future earnings may be garnished
in civil actions. To help protect the financial resources of
volunteers and employees, BSA local councils provide
liability insurance through the National Council.
A unit leader faced with recruiting additional volunteers
may find it useful to review BSA insurance programs. The
BSA self-funds the first million dollars of each liability
claim. Accident and sickness insurance pays regardless
of fault as long as the accident occurred during an official
Scouting activity and the unit or council has purchased
the coverage.
Many BSA volunteers also assist other organizations,
such as schools, churches, and sports leagues. The
prudent volunteer should realize that not all nonprofit
organizations provide volunteers support at levels similar
to the BSA. Many such groups offer liability insurance
coverage only to volunteers on the boards of directors.
National Camp Standards
Volunteers at the district
and council level should be
aware that state regula-
tions may impose increased
standards of care on multi-
unit activities. Also, the
BSA has additional stan-
dards beyond those in the
Guide to Safe Scouting that
govern day camp and resi-
dent camp activities. In
particular, the BSA requires that a camp aquatics
director must have training from a National Camping
School. BSA camp standards and state regulations
require certain numbers of the aquatics staff to
have professional-level lifeguard training, such as
BSA Lifeguard or Red Cross lifeguard training. Train-
ing in Safe Swim Defense or Aquatics Supervision:
Swimming and Water Rescue is not adequate.





Health Considerations
Reviewing Medical Histories
Both Safe Swim Defense for swimming and Safety Afloat for boating require the unit leader to assess whether there are
any health conditions that require special consideration:
A complete health history is required of all participants as evidence of fitness for swimming and boating activi-
ties. Forms for minors must be signed by a parent or legal guardian. Participants should be asked to relate any
recent incidents of illness or injury just prior to the activity. Supervision and protection should be adjusted to
anticipate any potential risks associated with individual health conditions. For significant health conditions, the
adult supervisor should require an examination by a physician and consult the parent, guardian, or caregiver for
appropriate precautions.
The BSA has established minimum standards for providing medical information before participation in various activities.
The type of information required depends on the duration, location, and rigor of the event. Printed forms are available
from council service centers or at www.scouting.org.
Chapter

Chapter 4: Health Considerations32
Policy on Use of the Annual Health
and Medical Record
The Annual Health and Medical Record consists of four parts.
Part A is a health history. Part B covers informed consent, hold
harmless/release agreement, talent release, and the person
whom parents or guardians authorize to take youth to and
from events. Parts A and B are to be completed at least annu-
ally by participants in all Scouting events.
Part C is a physical exam to be completed and signed by a
certified and licensed health-care provider—physician (MD
or DO), nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. The BSA
recommends that everyone who participates in a Scouting
event have an annual medical evaluation. However, Part C
is only required for events that exceed 72 consecutive hours,
for high-adventure base programs, or for activities that are
strenuous and demanding.
The height/weight limits in Part C must be strictly adhered to
when the event will take the unit more than 30 minutes away
from an emergency vehicle–accessible roadway.
Part D is to be reviewed by all participants of a high-adven-
ture program at one of the national high-adventure bases and
shared with the examining health-care provider before com-
pleting Part C.
Part D includes a Recreational Scuba Training Council medi-
cal statement and guidelines for the recreational scuba
diver physical examination that applies to participants in
scuba programs at the Florida National High Adventure Sea
Base. Scouts working on the Open Water Diver Certification
requirement for the Scuba Diving merit badge will be subject
to a similar medical review process by the agency conducting
their training.
The Annual Health and Medical Record must be signed by the
parent or guardian of a minor or the adult to whom they apply.
The unit leader should carry copies on remote trips so that
important information, such as drug allergies and contact
numbers, will be readily available if professional treatment
is needed.
The adult supervisor should review the health history
of every participant, youth and adult, for swimming or
boating activities and respect any recommendations of the
physician or other person licensed by the state to perform
physical examinations. Some medications increase
sensitivity to the sun. Individuals with severe allergic
reactions to insects and marine life will need immediate
access to self-administered medication. Certain chronic
conditions such as epilepsy, asthma, or diabetes may
require special precautions. For example, a person
with seizures controlled by medication may be able to
participate in normal swimming activities in a pool when
accompanied by a buddy familiar with the situation, but be
required to wear a flotation device when engaged in an
open-water snorkeling exercise. The unit leader should
discuss such situations with parents or guardians and
respect the privacy and the dignity of the person involved.
Medical information should be requested only when safety
is an issue, and shared only with permission with those
who need to know.
The most common medical conditions that require restricted
water contact are temporary and may not be noted on a
health history completed before the condition arose. Those
include ear infections, healing wounds, eye irritations, and
rashes. Since such conditions are not always visible, the
adult supervisor should ask parents about any recent medi-
cal problems just before the outing. Such a question can
be combined with standard permission slips that inform
parents of the nature of the activity and allow emergency
medical treatment for a youth in case of injury or illness
when a guardian cannot be contacted.
Aquatics activities often offer unique opportunities for
those with physical or learning disabilities. Any youth who
is able to join in unit activities on land can probably also
join in unit swimming and boating activities. Special pre-
cautions may be needed for those with impaired mobility,
sight, or hearing. Check with the participant and his or
her caregivers on appropriate safeguards and activities.
Health Protection
The supervisor of an aquatics activity needs to be alert
for health concerns that may develop during the session.
HIPAA
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996 does not apply to Scouting volunteers
who do not receive payment for medical treatment.
However, all units should take reasonable steps to
maintain confidentiality of medical histories, birth
dates, and other personal information.


Chapter 4: Health Considerations 33
Work with unit members, parents, and caregivers to
provide safe and fun aquatics activities for everyone
in the unit.
Check medical forms for any conditions that
necessitate special precautions. If in doubt,
check with parents.
Don’t forget to check for recent conditions not noted
on your forms.
Some conditions may require prompt treatment with
medications. Arrange for easy access for those in the
water. Know how to assist the person if needed.
Policy on Use of the Annual Health
and Medical Record
In order to provide better care for its members and to assist
them in better understanding their own physical capabilities,
the Boy Scouts of America recommends that everyone who
participates in a Scouting event have an annual medical
evaluation by a certified and licensed health-care provider—a
physician (MD or DO), nurse practitioner, or physician assistant.
Providing your medical information on this four-part form will
help ensure you meet the minimum standards for participation
in various activities. Note that unit leaders must always protect
the privacy of unit participants by protecting their medical
information.
Parts A and B are to be completed at least annually by
participants in all Scouting events. This health history, parental/
guardian informed consent and release agreement, and
talent release statement is to be completed by the participant
and parents/guardians. Attach a copy of both sides of your
insurance card.
Part C is the pre-participation physical exam that is required
for participants in any event that exceeds 72 consecutive
hours, for all high-adventure base participants, or when the
nature of the activity is strenuous and demanding. Service
projects or work weekends may fit this description. Part C is
to be completed and signed by a certified and licensed heath-
care provider—physician (MD or DO), nurse practitioner, or
physician assistant. It is important to note that the height/
weight limits must be strictly adhered to when the event will
take the unit more than 30 minutes away from an emergency
vehicle, accessible roadway, or when the program requires
it, such as backpacking trips, high-adventure activities, and
conservation projects in remote areas. See the FAQs for when
this does not apply.
Part D is required to be reviewed by all participants of a high-
adventure program at one of the national high-adventure bases,
as well as unit-based, high-adventure backcountry activities,
and shared with the examining health-care provider before
completing Part C.
• Philmont Scout Ranch. Participants and guests for Philmont
activities that are conducted with limited access to the
backcountry, including most Philmont Training Center
conferences and family programs, will not require completion

Chapter 4: Health Considerations34
Sun Protection. Youth may regard a minor sunburn as
a badge proclaiming their outdoor adventure and the
first step to a summer tan. However, exposure to the sun
should be carefully monitored. Only a short period in the
sun can lead to a painful burn that will spoil the rest of
the trip. Also, skin damage caused by the sun during the
first 18 years of life is a major cause of skin cancer as an
adult. Insist that participants use sunscreen as appropri-
ate. Pink skin that turns pale with touch is a sign of too
much exposure and a signal to either cover the skin with
opaque clothing or limit activities to the shade.
Sunscreen with an SPF rating of at least 15 should be
applied before exposure and reapplied after sweating or
swimming even if the product claims to be waterproof.
Although sunscreen will block part of the ultraviolet light
that causes damage, and prolong the safe exposure time,
applying more does not extend the period of protection,
which is still limited no matter how high the SPF number.
A white T-shirt will provide reasonable but not complete
protection, particularly if the shirt is wet.
Bright sunlight can also damage the eyes. A hat with a bill
that shades the eyes is useful, and sunglasses with UV
protection help protect against glare off the water. Polar-
ized glasses are recommended because reduction of
glare offers eye protection and makes it easier to observe
activity on or beneath the surface.
Heat Reactions. Exercise in high temperatures and
humidity can lead to dehydration, heat exhaustion, and
heatstroke. Avoid such consequences by making sure
that all participants have ready access to drinking water.
Drinking when thirsty should prevent dehydration. Eating
regular meals will help prevent electrolyte imbalance that
may lead to cramps. Anyone feeling dizzy, faint, nause-
ated, or weak should rest in the shade.
Cold Reactions. Too little heat is as dangerous as too
much heat. Even when the air is warm, exposure to cool
or cold water can quickly remove heat from the body.
Watch all participants for early signs of heat loss such
as shivering, goose bumps, and bluish lips. When those
occur, get the person out of the water and wind and into
dry clothing. When exposure to cold water is a possibility,
consider the use of wet suits, and include treatment for
hypothermia in your emergency action plan. See Chapter
14 for more information.
Waiting until a sunburn appears means you have
waited too long to protect your skin.
Sun exposure while young can lead to life-threatening
conditions when older. Check with a physician about
suspicious skin features.
Skin Cancer Foundation


Chapter 4: Health Considerations 35
Hyperventilation. Breathing is triggered by a buildup of
carbon dioxide rather than depletion of oxygen. Repeated
deep and rapid breathing, or hyperventilation, before
underwater swimming can result in loss of conscious-
ness by delaying the urge to breathe. Breath-holding is
an important stage in learning to swim, and the ability to
swim underwater is an important skill for snorkeling and
lifesaving. However, one or two deliberate breaths should
be sufficient. Caution anyone obviously breathing heavier
than normal before submerging. Because of concerns
with hyperventilation, competitive underwater swimming
events are not permitted in Scouting.
Because of the danger of overbreathing, breath-
holding contests are prohibited.
Ear Infections. Organisms in natural bodies of water can
multiply when water remains in the ear canal after swim-
ming, causing irritation and infection. Over-the-counter
eardrops contain ingredients that inhibit organism growth
(mild acid), help remove the water (alcohol), and prevent
over-drying (glycerin). Scouts may use such preparations
as a preventive measure with parental approval. Avoid
homemade solutions. Don’t place anything in the ear if pain
is present; instead, seek medical help.
Infectious Disease. Illness may be spread via contami-
nated water, particularly water polluted with fecal matter.
Avoid swallowing water while swimming, in either a pool
or a lake. Don’t swim in small stagnant bodies of water or
where livestock or waterfowl are prevalent. Observe any
warning signs posted by health officials. Popular beaches
may be temporarily closed due to unexpected sewage
release, low water, or other factors.
Water in swimming pools is actively disinfected. However,
typical pool chlorine levels do not immediately kill all
pathogens in water contaminated with fecal matter. If fecal
matter is released in a pool—from a toddler with diarrhea, for
example—cancel the swimming activity until another time.


Chapter 4: Health Considerations36
The Greatest Risk:
In good years, no one drowns at Scouting events. In tragic years, drowning incidents may be counted on the
fingers of one hand. However, year after year, two or more hands are needed to count the number of adults who
die during Scouting activities. The number one cause of death in Scouting and for the public at large is heart
disease. Statistically, unit leaders are less likely to need to rescue a youth from drowning than they are to need
aid themselves to survive cardiac arrest in the water.
In response, the BSA has implemented various initiatives such as annual physicals,
activity restrictions based on height/weight ratios, and CPR/AED training. Leader
fitness is also a common program theme. All adults should review the risk factors
for heart disease and do what they can to mitigate those risks, particularly through
exercise and a heart-healthy diet.
Although the first obvious symptom of a problem often appears
to be a fatal heart attack, nearly all patients have warning signs
such as chest pains and breathlessness immediately before
the attack.
During Scouting events, adult leaders need to watch
out for each other as well as the youth under their care.


Swim Classification Tests
Safe Swim Defense and Safety Afloat guidelines tailor activities to swimming ability. Therefore, the unit leader needs
to provide opportunities for swim classification before aquatics outings. Swim tests conducted by council personnel
during or just before summer camp give the unit one way to determine swimming ability. However, not all unit members
attend camp, new members may join the unit at any time, and some units plan aquatics activities in lieu of summer
camp. Therefore, the unit should be able to safely conduct its own swim tests.
Chapter
5


Swimmer Classifications
Scouting recognizes three basic swimming classifica-
tions: swimmer, beginner, and nonswimmer. Swim clas-
sification tests should be renewed annually, preferably at
the beginning of the season.
The swimmer test demonstrates the minimum level of
swimming ability required for safe deepwater swimming.
The various components of the test evaluate several
distinct, essential skills necessary for safety in the water.
A precise statement of the swimmer test is:
Jump feetfirst into water over the head in depth.
Level off and swim 75 yards in a strong manner
using one or more of the following strokes: side-
stroke, breaststroke, trudgen, or crawl; then swim
25 yards using an easy, resting backstroke. The
100 yards must be completed in one swim without
stops and must include at least one sharp turn.
After completing the swim, rest by floating.
The test administrator must objectively evaluate both the
ease of the overall performance and the purpose of each
test element. Any conscientious adult who is familiar with
basic swimming strokes and who understands and abides
by the following guidelines can administer the test.
1. “Jump feetfirst into water over the head in depth.
Level off . . .”
The swimmer must be able
to make an abrupt entry into
deep water and begin
swimming without any aids.
Walking in from shallow
water, easing in from the
edge or down a ladder,
pushing off from the side or
bottom, and gaining forward
momentum by diving do not satisfy this requirement. If the
swimming area available for the test is not quite over the
swimmer’s head in depth, or does not provide a platform for
jumping into deep water, then a person may be provisionally
classified as a swimmer if able to easily bob repeatedly up
and down in the water, then level off and begin swimming.
The head must submerge without the legs touching bottom.
Ideally, the feetfirst entry should be tested at the next
available opportunity.
2. “. . . swim 75 yards in a strong manner . . .”
The swimmer must be able
to cover distance with a
strong, confident stroke.
The 75 yards is not the
expected upper limit of the
swimmer’s ability. The dis-
tance should be covered in a manner that indicates suffi-
cient skill and stamina for the swimmer to continue to swim
for greater distances. Strokes repeatedly interrupted and
restarted are not sufficient. The sidestroke, breaststroke,
or any strong over-arm stroke, including the back crawl,
are allowed in any combination; dog paddling and
underwater strokes are not acceptable. The strokes need
to be executed in a strong manner, but perfect form is not
necessary. If it is apparent that the swimmer is being worn
out by a poorly executed, head-up crawl, it is appropriate
for the test administrator to suggest a change to a more
restful stroke. A skilled, confident swimmer should be able
to complete the distance with energy to spare, even if not
in top physical condition. There should be little concern if
a swimmer is out of breath because the distance was
intentionally covered at a fast pace. However, a swimmer
who barely has the energy to complete the distance will
benefit from additional skill instruction.
3. “. . . swim 25 yards using an easy, resting backstroke.”
The swimmer must demon-
strate a restful, free-breath-
ing backstroke that can be
used to avoid exhaustion
during swimming activity. It
is placed at the end of the
distance requirement to
emphasize the use of the backstroke as a relief from exertion
and may actually be used by some swimmers to catch their
breath if they swam the first part more strenuously than
needed. The change of stroke must be done without support
from side or bottom. Any effective variation of the elemen-
tary backstroke is acceptable. The form need not be perfect.
For example, a modified scissors kick may be substituted for
a whip kick. Restful strokes are emphasized in Scouting as
important safety skills that can be used whenever the swim-
mer becomes exhausted or injured. Some swimmers, par-
ticularly current or former members of competitive swim
teams, may not be familiar with the elementary backstroke.
A back crawl will suffice for the test if it clearly provides
opportunity for the swimmer to rest and catch the breath.
However, individuals successfully completing the test with
Chapter 5: Swim Classification Tests38


the back crawl should be encouraged to learn the
elementary backstroke.
4. “The 100 yards must be completed in one swim with-
out stops and must include at least one sharp turn.”
The total distance is to be
covered without rest stops.
It is acceptable for someone
to float momentarily to work
out a kink in a muscle or to
tread water to avoid colli-
sion with another swimmer, but not to make up for a poorly
executed stroke by repeatedly floating, grasping the side, or
touching the bottom. The sharp turn demonstrates the
important skill of reversing direction in deep water without
support. There is no time limit for completion of the test.
5. “After completing the swim, rest by floating.”
This critically important
component evaluates the
swimmers’ ability to sup-
port themselves indefi-
nitely in warm water when
exhausted or otherwise
unable to continue swim-
ming. Treading water will tire the swimmer and is there-
fore unacceptable. The duration of the float is not
significant, except that it should be long enough for the
administrator to determine that the swimmer is in fact
resting and could continue to do so. A back float with the
face out of the water is preferred, but restful facedown
floating is acceptable. If the test is completed except for
the floating requirement, the swimmer may be retested
on the floating only (after instruction), provided the test
administrator is confident that the swimmer can initiate
the float in deep water when exhausted.
A precise statement of the beginner test is:
Jump feetfirst into water over the head in depth,
level off, and swim 25 feet on the surface. Stop,
turn sharply, resume swimming and return to the
starting place.
The entry and turn serve the same purpose as in the
swimmer test. The swimming may be done with any sur-
face stroke. Underwater swimming is not allowed. The
stop assures that the swimmer can regain the stroke if
it is interrupted. The test demonstrates that the beginner
swimmer is ready to learn deepwater skills and has the
minimum ability required for safe swimming in a confined
area in which shallow water, sides, or other support is
less than 25 feet from any point on the water.
Anyone who has not completed either the beginner or the
swimmer test is classified as a nonswimmer. The title is
descriptive and nonjudgmental. It may represent those
just learning to swim who do not yet have the skills to
safely venture beyond shallow water. It may also apply to
those who have not yet been tested or who have elected
to forego the test and to accept the limitations on activi-
ties imposed by the classification.
Both nonswimmer and beginner classifications prevent a
Scout from gaining the full benefit of aquatics programming.
Unit leaders should promote swimming ability to all mem-
bers and strive to have everyone in the unit classified as
swimmers. Such a goal increases each Scout’s safety and
confidence, provides more recreational and instructional
opportunities, and makes it easy for units to administer their
own aquatics programs. Note that the beginner test is a
requirement for Boy Scout Second Class rank, whereas the
swimmer test is a requirement for First Class rank. A troop’s
ability to conduct swim classification tests also makes it
easier to administer rank advancement.
Testing Procedure
All swimming activities, including swim classification tests,
follow the elements of Safe Swim Defense. The health history
of each individual should be reviewed before testing. No one
should be allowed in the water against the recommendations
of parents, guardian, or physician. Those who are not allowed
to enter the water for whatever reason do not automatically
fall into the nonswimmer category. Normally, nonswimmers
are encouraged to participate in aquatics activities as an
incentive to improve their skills. If the aquatics activities are
conducted by the unit, then the adult in charge of the event
should know the difference between those classified as
nonswimmers on the basis of skill, and those not allowed to
swim due to a chronic or temporary physical condition that
limits water contact. The unit may be asked to conduct swim
classification tests before participation in a multiple-unit
event, such as summer camp or jamboree. In those cases,
care should be taken to preclude participation in an event as a
nonswimmer by someone who should not be in the water. The
unit leader should discreetly communicate such situations to
the event supervisor. The youth should be privately put on his
honor not to circumvent any restrictions.
Chapter 5: Swim Classification Tests 39


Situations may arise when special consideration should
be given to those with temporary medical conditions.
For example, yearly swim classification renewals may
be scheduled just before a canoe trip. A physician may
approve a person with an ear infection or a sutured
wound to go on the trip, but caution against submerg-
ing the head or the bandage. Since it would be difficult
to administer the swim test without getting the ears or
the wound wet, the adult leader might classify the Scout
temporarily as a nonswimmer. That, however, would pre-
vent the Scout from paddling in a canoe with their buddy.
If the unit leader has sufficient evidence that the Scout
is indeed a good swimmer—one who has earned the
Lifesaving merit badge, for example, or is a member of
a swim team—then an extension of the Scout’s previous
swimmer classification is appropriate until he heals suf-
ficiently to retake the test.
The ideal place to conduct a swim test is a swimming pool
with straight stretches of 25 to 50 yards and clear water
at least 7 feet deep at the point of entry. Those taking the
swimmer test can then be instructed simply to swim either
four or two lengths as appropriate. A pool 25 or 50 meters
in length is easily adapted by placing a turning mark or
line at the yard mark, or by having the person swim the
short extra distance. (Recall that the swimmer test is not
meant to demonstrate the maximum distance a person can
swim.) The course may also be laid out such that the swim-
mer follows a circular pattern around the pool rather than
back and forth, but be sure to incorporate the sharp turn
required by both beginner and swimmer tests.
Very small backyard or apartment pools (less than roughly
20 feet in the maximum direction) are fine for a unit swim,
but should be avoided as locations for swim classification
tests since likely contact with the sides and bottom during all
the turns makes it difficult to judge how well the person can
swim. Such pools may also be too shallow to meet the cri-
terion for a feetfirst entry into water over the head in depth.
Any natural body of water that satisfies Safe Swim Defense
requirements may be used for swim classification tests. Clear
water is preferred over murky water; warm water over cold
water. A pier that extends from shore to deep water is ideal for
the feetfirst entry in the requirements, but a floating platform
can also be used.
If a pool open to the public is used for testing, try to schedule
a time when the pool is less crowded. Inform pool personnel

Chapter 5: Swim Classification Tests40


fall just short of the required distances may be given a
few pointers, a rest, and another try. Those who cannot
complete the tests should be congratulated on how far
they got, encouraged to practice, and told that they will
be able to retake the test at a later date. If a person in a
swimsuit at the swimming area decides not to take either
test, then they should be encouraged to slip into shallow
water and show what they do know. That is, professed
nonswimmers should be part of the overall unit activity,
not shunted aside in the interest of time. Everyone should
be encouraged to try to swim to the best of their ability,
but no one should be coerced into the water.
Some participants may be willing to jump into water over their
head even though they have never done it. Therefore, every
participant should be asked if they have jumped into deep
water before. If they have not, first confirm that they can swim
in shallow water and then see if they are comfortable in deep
water with a slide-in entry at the edge. The test may proceed
once the person demonstrates comfort in deep water.
With proper screening, those taking the test should not
be at risk of a bad experience. Nevertheless, test admin-
istrators should be ready and able to provide immediate
assistance if the swimmer does need help, perhaps due to
a cramp or exhaustion. Ideally, the course for the begin-
ner test should be alongside a pool deck or pier so that the
swimmer is always within a hand’s reach or a single stroke
from support. The course for the swimmer test should be
within reach of a pole. The best way to keep poles ready
for use is to lay them along the edge of the pool or pier. A
pole is then within easy, unobtrusive access at all times. If
the course incorporates a floating dock in a natural body of
water, then the feetfirst entry and first few strokes should
be within easy reach. If the course then extends beyond
the reach of a pole, the swimmers should be either within
reach of rescue personnel in a rowboat or canoe or within
easy throwing distance of a ring buoy on a line or a throw
bag. If a person taking the test succeeds in leveling off
after the feetfirst jump, then the most likely need will be
to encourage a tired swimmer to come to the side under
their own power. In a few cases, a reaching assist may be
needed immediately after the feetfirst entry. Test admin-
istrators should be skilled in basic rescue techniques to
satisfy Safe Swim Defense guidelines for trained safety
personnel. If there are others in the water not taking part in
the testing, then additional response personnel (lifeguards)
are needed. In either case, a lookout is required to monitor
all in-water activity.
Tests measure comfort in the water but do not require
perfect form.
Rest stops are not allowed. However, the course
should be close to the side to allow for resting and
easy assists if needed.
of what you are doing. A guard may be willing to clear an area
briefly if you have only one or two Scouts who need the test.
During swim classification tests, the swimmer and the test
administrator form a buddy pair. If there is a large group
needing tests, then several testers are useful. Individual
testing is required. Unit members should not be aligned at
each lane and started at once, as in a swim competition.
Although the tests may be explained to the unit as a
whole, the test administrators should briefly review the
tests with each participant. Each person should be asked
if he or she would like to first try the beginner or the swim-
mer test. If the person asserts the ability to easily swim
100 yards, then it is not necessary to take the beginner
test before the swimmer test. If a person is hesitant,
they may take the beginner test first and follow it with
the swimmer test if that seems appropriate. Those who
Chapter 5: Swim Classification Tests 41


Swim Test Anxiety
Both the unit leader and the test administrator should be
sensitive to those who may be fearful of the water, uncer-
tain of their ability, worried about peer reaction, otherwise
apprehensive, or simply confused about the process and
what is expected of them. The unit leader should work with
the test administrator to help prepare such Scouts for the
swim test, particularly when it is conducted by someone
the Scout is unfamiliar with, such as staff at resident camp
or at a multiunit, council-organized swim test prior to camp.
The first day of a camp program may be an overwhelm-
ing experience for Scouts for many reasons—being away
from home and the support systems that home provides,
the thrill but uncertainty of what they will experience at
camp, and perhaps thoughts of how they will measure
up in comparison to their buddies. At summer camps, the
swim test is often the first program activity where Scouts
both interact significantly with those outside the unit and
are asked to perform to a standard. That experience may
produce significant anxiety for a small number of youth.
However, there is no justification for fears to be realized.
The unit leader can help prepare those Scouts both before
and at camp so that the swim test is a positive experience.
The following items should help leaders recognize and
reduce anxiety about the testing process:
• Early identification. Scouts who may be anxious around
the water or with the swim test process should be
identified well before summer camp or other event for
which the test is required. Comfort around the water
should be included in the leader’s discussion with par-
ents for youth who join the unit. The leader should also
talk to the youth themselves. For Cub Scouts, check to
see if swimming is an interest. For Boy Scouts, comfort
in the water should arise naturally during discussions
of advancement requirements for Second Class, which
includes the beginner test, and for First Class, which
includes the swimmer test. Be sure to watch for non-
verbal cues to see if their body language matches what
they say.
• Year-round swimming programs. A year-round swim-
ming program provides meaningful and fun activities
and allows the leader to observe firsthand the com-
fort level of Scouts around the water. It also provides
an opportunity to see how unit members respond to
those reluctant around the water or with lesser swim-
ming ability. For troops, it will help move Boy Scout
advancement along faster. Ideally, the first time the
Scout takes a swim test is during a learn-to-swim
class with a familiar, trusted instructor conducting the
exercise. Subsequent tests are just repeats of tasks
the swimmer knows they have accomplished before.
• Consider precamp swim tests. Some councils arrange
precamp swim tests for units. If that option is available,
consider whether youth with swim test anxiety might
perform better away from the other first-day camp
activities. If allowed, reluctant members of the unit
might arrive early to get adjusted to the water and take a
“mock” test prior to the “real” test. (Note that the camp
aquatics director may retest any Scout or leader whose
skills appear inconsistent with their classification.)
• Prepare the unit for the test. The leader should famil-
iarize Scouts with the swim test process as part of
the unit’s camp readiness discussions. Explain the
purpose of the test and how it will be conducted.
Explain that each youth’s swimming ability may be
different and that the better swimmers are expected
to encourage and support those with lesser ability.
Remind everyone that opportunities to retake the
test will be provided to those who don’t make it as
far as they would have liked. Encourage any youth
who needs to speak with the leader in private to do
so. And remember that no one should be forced—
whether by anyone’s statement or through peer pres-
sure—to take either test if they choose not to.
• Work with the camp aquatics director. The camp
aquatics director should approach the unit leader
when the unit arrives at the swimming area for ori-
entation before the test. That is an intentional oppor-
tunity for the leader to identify any medical concerns
and to discuss any youth who may be anxious about
the swim test. Make sure the aquatics director
assigns an empathetic, experienced staff member to
work with each such youth and stay with the youth
until the staff member establishes a reasonable rap-
port. The tests will be conducted one-on-one, so it
should be possible for leaders to stagger interac-
tions with more than one Scout. If the Scout remains
anxious, the leader may request the aquatics direc-
tor to arrange a special time to conduct the test for
that individual when there is less activity in the area
and more time for the youth to become comfortable
before taking the test.

Safe Swim Defense
All swimming activities in Scouting are required to follow the eight basic principles known collectively as the Safe Swim
Defense plan. The elements of Safe Swim Defense were formulated during the 1930s through careful study of swimming
emergencies. At the 1953 National Scout Jamboree in California, thousands of Scouts swam in the ocean with the plan in
place. Water-safety consultants cautioned BSA officials to expect a large number of drownings, based on public statistics.
There were none. Small refinements have been made to the plan over the years, but the basics have not changed.
The emphasis has always been on prevention. A unit that follows the plan can expect a safe, enjoyable experience.
Chapter
6


Chapter 6: Safe Swim Defense50
A summary of Safe Swim Defense was provided in
Chapter 3. The complete text is given here in bold type
with additional explanatory material in regular print.
BSA groups shall use Safe Swim Defense for all
swimming activities. Adult leaders supervising a
swimming activity must have completed Safe Swim
Defense training within the previous two years. Safe
Swim Defense standards apply at backyard, hotel,
apartment, and public pools; at established waterfront
swim areas such as beaches at state parks and U. S.
Army Corps of Engineers lakes; and at all temporary
swimming areas such as a lake, river, or ocean. Safe
Swim Defense does not apply to boating or water
activities such as waterskiing or swamped boat drills
that are covered by Safety Afloat guidelines. Safe
Swim Defense applies to other nonswimming activities
whenever participants enter water over knee deep or
when submersion is likely, for example, when fording
a stream, seining for bait, or constructing a bridge as a
pioneering project. Snorkeling in open water requires
each participant to have demonstrated knowledge and
skills equivalent to those for Snorkeling BSA in addition
to following Safe Swim Defense. Scuba activities must
be conducted in accordance with the BSA scuba policy
found in the Guide to Safe Scouting. Because of concerns
with hyperventilation, competitive underwater swimming
events are not permitted in Scouting.
Safe Swim Defense training may be obtained from
my.scouting.org, at council summer camps, and at other
council and district training events. Additional information
on various swimming venues is provided in the Aquatics
Supervision guide available from council service centers.
1. Qualified Supervision
All swimming activity must be supervised by a mature
and conscientious adult age 21 or older who understands
and knowingly accepts responsibility for the well-being
and safety of those in his or her care, and who is trained
in and committed to compliance with the eight points
of BSA Safe Swim Defense. It is strongly recommended
that all units have at least one adult or older youth
member currently trained in BSA Aquatics Supervision:
Swimming and Water Rescue or BSA Lifeguard to assist
in planning and conducting all swimming activities.
The purpose of this publication is to provide the unit
leader with sufficient information to confidently know
when he or she meets the expectations set forth in the
first point. This book also serves as the text for training
in Swimming and Water Rescue. Check with your council
service center for course offerings.
2. Personal Health Review
A complete health history is required of all participants
as evidence of fitness for swimming activities. Forms
for minors must be signed by a parent or legal guardian.
Participants should be asked to relate any recent incidents
of illness or injury just prior to the activity. Supervision and
protection should be adjusted to anticipate any potential
risks associated with individual health conditions. For
significant health conditions, the adult supervisor should
require an examination by a physician and consult with the
parent, guardian, or caregiver for appropriate precautions.
This important item is shared with Safety Afloat and was
covered in detail in Chapter 4.
3. Safe Area
All swimming areas must be carefully inspected and
prepared for safety prior to each activity. Water depth,
quality, temperature, movement, and clarity are important
considerations. Hazards must be eliminated or isolated by
conspicuous markings and discussed with participants.
• Controlled Access: There must be safe areas for all
participating ability groups to enter and leave the
water. Swimming areas of appropriate depth must be
defined for each ability group. The entire area must
be within easy reach of designated rescue personnel.
The area must be clear of boat traffic, surfing, or other
nonswimming activities.


Chapter 6: Safe Swim Defense 51
• Bottom Conditions and Depth: The bottom must be
clear of trees and debris. Abrupt changes in depth
are not allowed in the nonswimmer area. Isolated
underwater hazards should be marked with floats.
Rescue personnel must be able to easily reach
the bottom. Maximum recommended water depth
in clear water is 12 feet. Maximum water depth in
turbid water is 8 feet.
• Visibility: Underwater swimming and diving are
prohibited in turbid water. Turbid water exists
when a swimmer treading water cannot see their
feet. Swimming at night is allowed only in areas
with water clarity and lighting sufficient for good
visibility both above and below the surface.
• Diving and Elevated Entry: Diving is permitted only
into clear, unobstructed water from heights no
greater than 40 inches. Water depth must be at least
7 feet. Bottom depth contours below diving boards
and elevated surfaces require greater water depths
and must conform to state regulations. Persons
should not jump into water from heights greater than
they are tall, and should jump only into water chest
deep or greater with minimal risk from contact with
the bottom. No elevated entry is permitted where the
person must clear any obstacle, including land.
• Water Temperature: Comfortable water temperature
for swimming is near 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Activity
in water at 70 degrees or less should be of limited
duration and closely monitored for negative effects
of chilling.
• Water Quality: Bodies of stagnant, foul water, areas
with significant algae or foam, or areas polluted by
livestock or waterfowl should be avoided. Comply
with any signs posted by local health authorities.
Swimming is not allowed in swimming pools with
green, murky, or cloudy water.
• Moving Water: Participants should be able to easily
regain and maintain their footing in currents or
waves. Areas with large waves, swiftly flowing
currents, or moderate currents that flow toward the
open sea or into areas of danger should be avoided.
• Weather: Participants should be moved from the
water to a position of safety whenever lightning or
thunder threatens. Wait at least 30 minutes after the
last lightning flash or thunder before leaving shelter.
Take precautions to prevent sunburn, dehydration,
and hypothermia.
• Life Jacket Use: Swimming in clear water over 12 feet
deep, in turbid water over 8 feet deep, or in flowing
water may be allowed if all participants wear
properly fitted, Coast Guard–approved life jackets
and the supervisor determines that swimming with
life jackets is safe under the circumstances.
The detailed application of some Safe Swim Defense
principles, such as area safety, depends on location. Less effort
is needed to ensure area safety if the unit takes advantage of
established swimming areas, but temporary swimming areas
may also be used with appropriate preparation.
Established swimming areas include public pools and
waterparks; lake and ocean beaches maintained by
federal, state, or local agencies; and private residential,
apartment, and hotel pools. Some will have trained
lifeguards on duty; others will not. Avoid venues where
crowds hinder supervision.
Temporary swimming areas may be set up on the shores
of lakes, quarries, rivers, or oceans, or be laid out in
relation to a boat anchored away from shore. In areas
not designed and regularly maintained for swimming,
unit leadership should use a limited number of skilled
swimmers to systematically examine and prepare the
area. The buddy system and rescue personnel must be in
place anytime anyone is in the water during area setup.
Diving boards, water slides, rope swings, floats, and
other play equipment must meet state requirements for
construction and supervision. Established areas should
have signs warning against diving into shallow water.
In the absence of such signs, all participants should be
cautioned against possible injuries caused by impact
with the bottom or the water. Dives into shallow water,
competitive-style dives, or cliff dives are not allowed.
Diving areas must be clear of other swimmers.
There is no set height from which a feetfirst entry is always
safe below that height and always risky an inch above the
limit. Those learning to swim may be asked to jump feetfirst
from the side into depths where their feet will touch the
bottom. For any heights above a few inches, the water
must be deep enough that contact is not made with the
bottom. The unit leader should carefully assess the safety
of any activity, such as an abandon-ship drill, whenever the
height of a jump exceeds the height of the person.


Chapter 6: Safe Swim Defense52
4. Response Personnel (Lifeguards)
Every swimming activity must be closely and continuously
monitored by a trained rescue team on the alert for and
ready to respond during emergencies. Professionally
trained lifeguards satisfy this need when provided by a
regulated facility or tour operator. When lifeguards are
not provided by others, the adult supervisor must assign
at least two rescue personnel, with additional numbers
to maintain a ratio of one rescuer to every 10 participants.
The supervisor must provide instruction and rescue
equipment and assign areas of responsibility as outlined
in this book. The qualified supervisor, the designated
response personnel, and the lookout work together
as a safety team. An emergency action plan should be
formulated and shared with participants as appropriate.
If the other elements of Safe Swim Defense are in place,
water rescues will seldom be needed. Most lifeguards at
Scout summer camps, many of whom work several seasons,
are never called upon to make a rescue. The same should be
true at unit swims. Even so, there is always some chance of an
unexpected medical emergency or other situation that could
incapacitate a person in the water. Fortunately, rescues in
a controlled situation are relatively safe, simple, and easy
to learn. Danger could arise if a would-be rescuer is a poor
swimmer ill-trained and ill-equipped for the situation, or if
water conditions are hazardous. However, hazardous water
situations would violate the third tenet of Safe Swim Defense
and should not be present at a unit swim site. Chapter 9 will
alert the reader to skills that should be mastered to ensure
victim and rescuer safety, the equipment that supports those
skills, and situations that should be included in emergency
action plans. Older youth and adults who have completed the
Lifesaving merit badge, BSA Swimming and Water Rescue,
or BSA Lifeguard requirements are candidates for response
personnel. Other good swimmers may be used to maintain
the required 1-to-10 ratio if coached in basic surveillance
and rescue techniques. The line-and-tender procedure for
the First Class rank is one such technique.
Adult leaders, including the qualified supervisor, may
serve as response personnel for an entire activity
that is not too long. Short breaks in concentration are
provided during buddy checks. If youth are used, they will
generally need to be rotated so that they too may enjoy
the activity. The emergency action plan may specify that
response personnel with more training will handle special
situations, such as a spinal injury, whereas all response
personnel may respond when a reaching rescue is
indicated. Response personnel will generally work as
buddy pairs, with each buddy monitoring the other.
5. Lookout
The lookout continuously monitors the conduct of the
swim, identifies any departures from Safe Swim Defense
guidelines, alerts response personnel as needed, and
monitors the weather and environment. The lookout
should have a clear view of the entire area but be close
enough for easy verbal communication. The lookout must
have a sound understanding of Safe Swim Defense but
is not required to perform rescues. The adult supervisor
may serve simultaneously as the lookout but must assign
the task to someone else if engaged in activities that
preclude focused observation.
Failure of timely recognition of a drowning situation is
a common factor in the rare fatalities that occur where
trained lifeguards are on duty. At public facilities, it is
not uncommon for a single guard to scan an area that
contains several dozen swimmers of various abilities.


Chapter 6: Safe Swim Defense 53
Safe Swim Defense adds an extra margin of safety by
increasing the likelihood that a person in trouble will
quickly be noticed. The ratio of watchers to swimmers is
high, and there is redundancy in surveillance. A buddy
looks after a partner, multiple response personnel watch
assigned areas, and a lookout watches overall.
6. Ability Groups
All youth and adult participants are designated as
swimmers, beginners, or nonswimmers based on
swimming ability confirmed by standardized BSA swim
classification tests. Each group is assigned a specific
swimming area with depths consistent with those
abilities. The classification tests should be renewed
annually, preferably at the beginning of the season.
• Swimmers pass this test: Jump feetfirst into water
over the head in depth. Level off and swim 75 yards
in a strong manner using one or more of the following
strokes: sidestroke, breaststroke, trudgen, or crawl;
then swim 25 yards using an easy, resting backstroke.
The 100 yards must be completed in one swim without
stops and must include at least one sharp turn. After
completing the swim, rest by floating.
• Beginners pass this test: Jump feetfirst into water
over the head in depth, level off, and swim 25 feet on
the surface. Stop, turn sharply, resume swimming,
and return to the starting place.
• Anyone who has not completed either the beginner
or swimmer tests is classified as a nonswimmer.
• The nonswimmer area should be no more than waist
to chest deep and should be enclosed by physical
boundaries such as the shore, a pier, or lines. The
enclosed beginner area should contain water of
standing depth and may extend to depths just over
the head. The swimmer area may be up to 12 feet in
depth in clear water and should be defined by floats
or other markers.
Details for administering the swim classification tests
were covered in Chapter 5. Anyone may stay in the
nonswimmers’ area without taking a test. If conducting
swim classification tests is not practical for a special
occasion, then everyone may be classified by default
as a nonswimmer and accommodated in an enlarged
shallow-water area. Areas for the three ability groups
only need to be specified for those groups that are
present. For example, if a unit has only nonswimmers and
swimmers, there is no need to define a beginner area. If
a small pool is everywhere less than 5 feet deep, and the
unit has only beginners and swimmers, then the entire
pool can be a single area.
7. Buddy System
Every participant is paired with another. Buddies stay
together, monitor each other, and alert the safety team
if either needs assistance or is missing. Buddies check
into and out of the area together.
• Buddies are normally in the same ability group
and remain in their assigned area. If they are not of
the same ability group, then they swim in the area
assigned to the buddy with the lesser ability.
• A buddy check reminds participants of their
obligation to monitor their buddies and indicates
how closely the buddies are keeping track of each
other. Roughly every 10 minutes, or as needed to keep
the buddies together, the lookout, or other person
designated by the supervisor, gives an audible
signal, such as a single whistle blast, and a call
for “Buddies.” Buddies are expected to raise each
other’s hand before completion of a slow, audible
count to 10. Buddies who take longer to find each
other should be reminded of their responsibility for
the other’s safety.
• Once everyone has a buddy, a count is made by area
and compared with the total number known to be in
the water. After the count is confirmed, a signal is
given to resume swimming.
The supervisor must establish a system for tracking
everyone who enters the water and their ability. Any system
that identifies each swimmer, his or her buddy, and their
ability group is sufficient. A handwritten list on a leader’s
clipboard is easy and adequate. Buddy boards and tags
are useful when more than one unit is involved in a district
or council activity. Everyone in the area has a buddy and
is counted as part of a buddy check, including the lookout
and response personnel. If the number of participants is
odd, there may be one triple assigned as buddies.


Chapter 6: Safe Swim Defense54
8. Discipline
Rules are effective only when followed. All participants
should know, understand, and respect the rules and
procedures for safe swimming provided by Safe Swim
Defense guidelines. Applicable rules should be discussed
prior to the outing and reviewed for all participants at the
water’s edge just before the swimming activity begins.
People are more likely to follow directions when they know
the reasons for rules and procedures. Consistent, impartially
applied rules supported by skill and good judgment provide
steppingstones to a safe, enjoyable outing.
Like the bread that holds together a sandwich, discipline
and qualified supervision are the foundation and the
Divide and Conquer. The effectiveness of supervision and discipline, as well as instruction, may depend on group size.
Certain activities are often easier to oversee with a patrol of eight Scouts and two adults rather than with an entire
troop of 30 Scouts and three adults. Particularly when trying things for the first time, leaders may wish to subdivide large
groups to enhance the experience for all. Subdividing a large group is also useful when the activity requires special
gear, such as snorkeling equipment, that is in short supply. Scouts having to wait a long time for their turn at an activity
naturally become bored and restless. That, in turn, may lead to discipline problems.
cover that make safe Scouting a reality. Scouts are
accustomed to following rules in other situations and
will likely also be well-behaved during swimming events.
That is particularly true if the Scouts are reminded of their
dual responsibility for their own safety and that of others
in the unit. Likewise, youth leadership should share in
decisions and guidance. However, youthful exuberance
may at times cause momentary lapses in attention; fun
and a sense of adventure can overwhelm common sense.
Dealing with such situations is a learning experience
for youth and leaders, but leaders should realize that
youngsters cannot always be expected to act rationally
in the interest of their own safety. Adult leaders should
therefore accept that they, not the Scouts, are ultimately
responsible for implementing BSA rules and procedures.


Swimming Locations
The application of Safe Swim Defense principles varies somewhat based on the setting. Means for marking areas
for ability groups at an ocean beach differ from those at a small above-ground pool. Rescue equipment available on
a backpacking trip may vary from that on a canoe trip. Professional medical assistance may be minutes away from
an urban backyard pool but hours away from a remote camping site. So long as the basic concepts of each point of
Safe Swim Defense are in place, flexibility is allowed in their execution. The following review of common settings should
help the unit leader adapt the principles to various situations. All eight points of Safe Swim Defense apply at all times.
If an item is not discussed under a particular heading, it is common to other situations that have already been covered.
Chapter
7


Chapter 7: Swimming Locations56
Private Pools
The most common drowning incident at private pools
occurs when an unsupervised toddler enters the water.
A second risk factor arises from headfirst dives into
shallow water. Otherwise, the small size, shallow depth,
and clear water provide a safe venue. Rescues, if needed,
are relatively simple, and EMS services are often close
at hand. However, the familiarity and apparent simplicity
of the setting can lead to complacency. Unobserved
drownings occur at private pool parties even when
several people are present. As always, it is essential for
supervisory personnel to maintain close, uninterrupted
surveillance of the area. Many private pools are too small
to comfortably accommodate an entire pack or troop at
once. Rather than allow Scouts to move at will from one
backyard activity to another, tracking those in the water
may be easier if only a single den or patrol is allowed in
the water at one time.
Appropriate rescue equipment includes reach poles and
flotation devices, such as a rescue tube or ring buoy. The
emergency action plan should cover extension assists
for active victims, wading rescues for unconscious
victims, and the location of a phone for calling emergency
services. The “tailgate” review before the swim should
include the importance of watching your buddy, signals
and procedures for buddy checks and emergencies, and
prohibition of headfirst entry.
Considerations for private in-ground pools:
• Too shallow for diving
• Swimmer and beginner areas may be combined if
depth less than 6 feet
• Will need rescue equipment such as reach pole and
flotation aid
• Extension assists from the side may suffice for
conscious victims; wading assists may reach
unconscious victims
• Lookout may be placed at shallow end with two
response personnel on opposite sides at deep end
• Lines across pool provide area boundaries but should
not pose tripping hazards
• EMS response time often short
Considerations for above-ground pools:
• Similar to private in-ground pools; e.g., no diving
• The entire pool may be a single ability area, given the
fixed depth and small size
• Fixed depth may be too deep for short nonswimmers,
who may need approved flotation devices
If the pool does not have a raised deck:
• May need to station lookout on a temporary stand,
such as a stepladder, with guard team at entry ladder
for visibility
• Removal of large incapacitated person from the pool
needs consideration


Chapter 7: Swimming Locations 57
Apartment and Hotel Pools
Semiprivate pools without lifeguards on duty are similar to
private pools but are shared with others. Defining areas for
ability groups with lines across the pool may not be prac-
tical. In that case, instruct nonswimmers not to go past a
certain point, such as a ladder, and station the lookout at
that location as a reminder and to enforce the rule. Many
newer pools have a maximum depth of 5 feet, so separate
beginner and swimmer areas may not be needed. If the
unit is small enough, and the pool not crowded, unit safety
team members can do frequent head counts in lieu of
formal buddy checks. Otherwise, a visual signal for a buddy
check may be substituted for an audible one, with the unit
all meeting at one end of the pool. (Recall that the primary
purpose of a buddy check is to reinforce the concept of each
person watching another. A slightly prolonged procedure
still accomplishes that goal. Buddy checks are not conducted
often enough to serve as the primary indication that a
person has submerged. Prompt recognition of an emergency
is the joint responsibility of the buddy, the response
personnel, and the lookout.)
Most states require semiprivate
pools to post rules, depth mark-
ers, no-diving signs, and rescue
equipment such as a reach
pole (or shepherd’s crook), a
ring buoy, and sometimes a
backboard. Before the swim,
make sure the equipment is in
working order. Determine how
best to summon EMS—by cell
phone, through an attendant, or
by house phone to the office, for example. Make sure you
know how to provide directions. The dispatcher may not
be able to bring up your location if a cell phone is used,
and rescuers may need instructions on how to find the
pool from the main entrance. The emergency action plan
should include how to deal with situations involving those
in the pool who are not members of the unit.
Considerations for hotel and apartment pools:
• Dealing with other users
• Alternate means to define ability areas
• Checking rescue equipment
• How best to summon EMS
Established Lakefront
Swimming Areas
Swimming is often done in lakes, ponds, dammed rivers, and
quarries. Although clear-water springs can provide water
quality and clarity close to that of a swimming pool, visibility
is impaired in many natural bodies of water. In clear water,
swimmers and those in trouble may be tracked underwater,
and a search for a submerged person takes only seconds
when safety team members are positioned with clear views
of the surface and the bottom. In murky water, the margin for
error is reduced. Prompt rescue requires that an emergency
is spotted before a person submerges. Locating a submerged
person in turbid water may take more time than the victim has.
Every aspect of Safe Swim Defense needs rigorous attention.
Public lakefront swimming areas are maintained at many
state and federal parks. Even though such areas often do
not have lifeguards on duty, they may be equipped with
changing facilities, sandy beaches, floating platforms,
buoys that restrict boating, and other amenities that make
them reasonable choices for a unit swim.


Chapter 7: Swimming Locations58
If possible, a unit should conduct its swim in an otherwise
unoccupied portion of a public beach within the designated
swimming area. Before the swim, good swimmers should
check depths and set up ability group areas accordingly,
using already established buoy lines as appropriate.
The unit may need to bring its own rescue equipment to
a lakefront swimming area. Reach poles will be of limited
usefulness on a sloping beach. Instead, equip rescue per-
sonnel with lines and flotation devices. Emergency action
plans need to consider the possibility of submerged victim
recovery. To make that task easier, the adult leader may
wish to limit the extent of the swimmer area and the depth to
less than the 8 feet allowed in Safe Swim Defense. Depend-
ing on the area and the experience of the safety team, it
may be prudent to have all participants wear life jackets.
Check with park personnel on the availability of EMS.
Considerations at unguarded public lakefronts:
• Dealing with other users
• Checking depths
• Defining ability areas using existing markers
• Submerged victim recovery
• How to summon emergency aid
Rarely, a person will be apprehensive of turbid water
even though he or she can swim well in a pool. Such
people will probably self-limit activities in a natural
body of water and may need patient encouragement
along with remedial exercises before they become
comfortable with a swim test or boat swamping
exercise. They should not be assigned as response
personnel if they are uncomfortable with the setting.
Temporary Lakefront Areas
A unit may take advantage of lakefront areas at a private
residence, near a remote campsite, or on a break dur-
ing a lake canoe trip. Setting up a safe swimming area in
such settings obviously requires more effort than using
a purpose-built pool or a beach maintained in a park.
However, the benefits are often worth the effort, and the
challenge can strengthen unit teamwork.
The first task is to find a promising location free from
obvious pollution or other hazards with easy access to
the water. A sandy beach sloping into shallow water is
ideal. Muddy bottoms with high weeds or quarries with
steep sides may not be suitable. Location scouting is gen-
erally done in advance by a small group rather than by the
complete unit ready to swim.
Considerations for temporary lakefront areas:
• Select an area free from obvious hazards—this
one is not.
Next, the area needs to be checked for appropriate
depths and underwater hazards. Safe Swim Defense
principles apply when checking the area. Everyone in the
water must be classified as a swimmer with a buddy, and
personnel onshore should be prepared to provide emer-
gency assistance.
In shallow water, have a small group of swimmers wear-
ing shoes link hands in a line from shortest to tallest. The
tallest wades out perpendicular to shore, and then the
line moves parallel to the shore while shuffling their feet.
If necessary, several passes are made until the area is
searched to the extent of standing depth. An occasional
limb or piece of trash can be removed. If the area is full of
debris, then another site needs to be found.


Chapter 7: Swimming Locations 59
• Use a line of swimmers to check shallow water.
As the waders cross the area, note approximately where
waist-deep, chest-deep, and chin-deep water occurs.
Bottom contours are seldom ideal. If the water is too shal-
low too far out, then rescuers on the shore may be too far
from the swimmers to be effective. If the water drops off
too rapidly, then nonswimmer and beginner areas may
not be big enough to accommodate those groups. How-
ever, only those areas for which there are participants
need to be defined. If all in the unit are swimmers, then
there is no need to set up the other areas.
If the water clarity is good enough, two or four swimmers
can survey deeper water for trees or other hazards from
the surface. One or two such obstacles can be avoided
when the swimming area is marked. Numerous obstacles
make the area unsafe. A single pair of good swimmers
should be used to check the depth. One swimmer should
make a feetfirst surface dive with shoes on while the
other watches from the surface. Once the water is too
deep for the swimmer to easily reach bottom, that defines
the maximum extent of the swimming area. Twelve feet is
the recommended maximum depth for clear water in Safe
Swim Defense, but the working definition of a safe depth
is one where the rescue personnel can reliably make it to
the bottom.
If the bottom can’t be seen from the surface, determine
whether there is sufficient area in water less than chin
deep to provide adequate room for the desired ability
groups. Consider extending the area along the shore
rather than out from shore. If an adequate swimming area
can be established in turbid water at chin deep or less, it
may be prudent to stop at that point. Deep water is not
essential to a fun swim.
• If needed, use two swimmers with line to check
deep water.
If a bit more area is needed because the bottom slopes
steeply, and the bottom has been clear of debris out
to chin deep, then murky water over the head can be
surveyed by a single pair of good swimmers. For extra
safety, the feetfirst diver should be loosely attached to
a line with a large bowline across the shoulders. The
diver’s buddy supports the line at the surface, but
the other end of the line is held by another buddy pair
stationed onshore or in shallow water. To avoid the
possibility of entanglement, the diver should work out in
straight lines from shallow water using closely spaced,
feet first vertical dives. That is, the diver should not
attempt to swim along the bottom looking for obstacles.
• Use lines and floats to define nonswimmer and
beginner areas.
Once the entire area is surveyed and determined to be
free of hazards, then the advance group needs to establish
boundaries for the ability groups. Lines for nonswimmer
and beginner areas can be extended from shore to poles
stuck in the bottom, stretched parallel to shore to another
support, and then returned to shore. Floats may be made
from balloons, plastic bottles, life jackets, or even sticks.
Twine is useful for anchor line and can be used with


Chapter 7: Swimming Locations60
additional floats as boundary lines. Brightly colored ¼-inch
floating polypropylene rope may be a better choice. A
physical boundary is needed to prevent a nonswimmer
from inadvertently swimming into water over the head or
a beginner from swimming too far out. The outer bounds
of the swimmer area only need to be marked by floats.
Reusable bags filled with rocks or sand may be used
as anchors.
• Use floats to define the swimmer area.
Swimmers need access to deep water without crossing
the nonswimmer and beginner areas, and may also enjoy
an area of shallow water for their own use. A “traditional”
layout has a narrow corridor for the swimmers along the
edge of the beginner and nonswimmer areas. If available,
fixed or floating docks may be used as part of the area
boundaries, with access to the areas from the dock rather
than the shore. A detached floating dock may also be used
as a platform for swimmers and rescue personnel. If docks
are used, areas under them should be off limits.
Bottom conditions may dictate the size of the areas, but
each swimmer should have roughly 50 square feet of
space. The areas should also be of a size and shape that
guards can easily reach all points. If a line-and-tender
team is assigned as primary rescue personnel, then no
point in the combined areas should be beyond the length
of the rescue line. The areas may be larger if multiple
guard teams are used, either onshore or in a boat.
• Ensure entire area
is in easy sight of
the lookout and
easily accessible
to rescuers.
Some bodies of water, particularly lakes formed by dams,
are bounded in areas by rock cliffs and ledges. Such sites
often tempt youth to test their mettle by diving or jumping
into the water from as high as possible. Recall that diving
is allowed from a maximum height of 40 inches into clear,
deep water. There is no magic height above the water at
which feetfirst entry goes from safe to hazardous, but Safe
Swim Defense guidelines caution against jumping from
heights greater than a person is tall.
• Recall guidelines for elevated entry.


Chapter 7: Swimming Locations 61
At remote settings, the emergency action plan needs to
include means to summon and connect with outside help.
Note: Cell phones do not work in all areas.
Rivers
After a hard day of paddling, a dip in the river can be
refreshing, but safe swimming in a flowing river requires
an understanding and appreciation of river currents. Cur-
rents define how depths vary across a river as well as
presenting the potential hazard of pushing a swimmer
downstream. Free-flowing rivers as unit swim sites are
best suited to Scout or Venturing units with a majority of
members classified as swimmers. Such rivers are not
recommended sites for Cub Scout swimming or for units
with a large percentage of poor swimmers.
Because rivers differ significantly from still-water bodies
and from one to another, an overview of river properties is
useful before discussing how to set up a safe swim area in
a river. There will be numerous situations to avoid, but also
several options for a safe area. Conducting a safe swim in
a river requires the unit leader to exercise more judgment
than setting up a safe swim in a small backyard pool. If all
factors do not fall into place, the unit leader should find
another area or cancel the swimming activity.
Rivers change dramatically between low water and flood
stage. At low water in a large river, there may be more
than one channel separated by sandbars. The main chan-
nel may still have significant water flow, but subsidiary
channels tend to be slow and shallow. The secondary
channels may be good candidates for a simple wading
area. All ability groups can splash around and cool off
even if the water is not deep enough for swimming.
Rivers at flood stage are dangerous. Do not swim or wade
during high flows—when the river is out of its banks, for
example. Debris flowing past is also a sign of high water.
River levels between extremes can be deceptive. Even
an apparently gentle river without waves can conceal a
major current. Look for partially submerged vegetation
at the edge of the river to determine whether it is higher
than normal. Also monitor the water level during a swim.
Rains or dam releases far upstream can quickly increase
currents and flows.


Chapter 7: Swimming Locations62
Although ever changing, river currents do behave in
generally predictable ways. When an unobstructed river
flows straight, the deepest water and fastest current will
be near midstream. The faster water in the center of the
channel draws water from the edges along the surface.
A swimmer floating near the river’s edge will slowly be
drawn into the main current.
When the river makes a turn, the deepest water and
fastest current will be on the outside of the bend. A steep
bank and undercut trees often characterize the outside of
the bend; the inside of the bend may have shallow, relatively
slow water. Swimmers unfamiliar with rivers may get into
trouble because they do not realize that both the depth of
the water and the strength of the current can vary rapidly
as they wade out from the flat, sandy area on the inside of a
bend. If an unwary swimmer, or a capsized boater, is caught
in a river current free of obstructions, he or she should swim
for shore, ideally toward the side on the inside of a bend.
Because of the current, the swimmer will actually move
downstream at an angle to the shore.
If the bend in the river is sharp, a countercurrent, or eddy,
may form on the backside of the turn, as shown in the
illustration. That is, the water actually flows upstream.
Crossing the eddy line may cause problems for unwary
swimmers and boaters. (Learn more about eddies in
Chapter 19 on river boating.)
Water depths in many small rivers are two shallow for
swimming and boating except in pools created by small
dams constructed for irrigation or recreation. Such dams
impede but don’t stop the flow. The pools may be very long
even behind a low dam and generally make good swimming
areas. However, be aware that bottom contours and debris
may change from one visit to the next, particularly after
floods. In dry summer months, the water may fall below the
outlet and become stagnant and unfit for swimming.
When the water is flowing, the current in the pool is
generally slight, but nevertheless present. Swimmers
should stay well away from the outlet, which might be
a large, barely submerged pipe, an adjustable chute at
the bottom of the dam, or a small cut and spillway with
water flowing over the top of the dam. In some cases, the
entire length of the dam serves as the outlet. Such dams
were designed to dissipate the energy of the water by
recirculating the flow back toward the dam. That creates
an extremely dangerous situation called a hydraulic,


Chapter 7: Swimming Locations 63
also known as a “drowning machine.” A person caught
between the dam and the boil line will be endlessly
tumbled. The only ways out—both risky—are to work
toward the side abutments or to dive for the bottom in
search of a downstream flow not blocked by debris or
design barriers. Never swim near a hydraulic.
A whitewater rapid is no place for a swimmer. However,
some whitewater rivers are the “pool and drop” variety.
Most of the change in elevation occurs near stepped
falls followed by sometimes lengthy sections of relatively
slight gradient. The pools between the drops can be good
places for a swimming break, provided the current is not
strong enough to sweep swimmers into the next rapid.
To establish a safe swim area in a river, first consider the
current. Avoid currents strong enough to sweep swim-
mers off their feet and places where a weak current is
likely to carry a swimmer into an area of danger, such as
a strainer, a hydraulic, or a series of rapids. Look for safe
areas on slow-moving rivers on the inside of a bend, in a
pool between small drops, or behind a dam that has only
a slight water flow over a spillway.
A sand or gravel beach on the inside of a river bend
makes a likely spot. Locate the swimming area on the
upstream side of the beach so that swimmers have the
rest of the beach as a safe haven if needed. Check the
depth and the current toward the main channel using a
good swimmer attached to a line. Make sure the line is
held securely: a single person may not be able to hold a
swimmer stepping into the current. If the current in the
channel is strong enough that swimmers will be moved

downstream, then limit the swimmers area outside of
the channel. It is not necessary for Scouts to have water
over the head in depth for them to cool off and have
fun. Safe Swim Defense policies define maximum, not
minimum, swimming depths.
Although makeshift buoys or other isolated objects are
often sufficient to define a swimmer area, floating lines
can provide additional assurance that swimmers remain
away from off-limit areas. Stretching a line diagonally
across the width of the river is sometimes feasible, but
not always practical, particularly if boaters are using the
area at the same time. If the depth of the swimmers area


Chapter 7: Swimming Locations64
is less than chest deep, then an alternative to anchors
is to have the line held by safety personnel. Attach one
end of a long line onshore at the downstream end of the
area. Have two members of the safety team wade out
with the rope to just over waist deep. One person remains
there to define the maximum distance from shore and
supports the line in place. The other person continues
with the line upstream and parallel to the shore. The
resulting L-shaped corral defines the swimmers area.
If needed, either person can drop the line to assist a
person in trouble. Alternately, the line may be pulled
toward a distressed swimmer.
Regardless of whether safety personnel are deployed in the
water, there should also be a line-and-tender team onshore.
Other safety team members can be positioned with a throw
bag near the downstream end of the area. If the condition of
the bank is such that a swimmer swept downstream by the
current cannot easily be followed onshore, then a boat may
be kept on standby to retrieve such a person.
A flowing river is less than ideal for a unit with a large
percentage of nonswimmers and beginners. However, the
technique described above can be used to define a small
region of shallow water for a combined nonswimmer/
beginner area. In that case, extend the upstream end of the
line back to shore to completely enclose the area. Having
the bathers wear life jackets will provide an extra margin
of safety.
If there is a noticeable current beyond the confines of the
established swimmer area, Scouts may well ask permission
to jump into the current, float downstream, exit, and repeat.
In the proper circumstances, such a natural “waterpark ride”
provides an opportunity to teach river boaters swift-water
survival skills in a controlled setting. However, “control” is
the key. The downstream area needs to be free of obstacles
for a long distance, and there needs to be an easy place to
exit. Limit such an activity to swimmers, have them wear life
jackets, and instruct them to float feetfirst. Allow only one
person to “launch” at a time. Make sure the course is within
easy reach of a throw bag over the entire route. Also consider
putting a “safety line” in the water near the exit.
Ocean
Establishing a safe swimming area in the ocean requires
consideration of currents, waves, access, and marine
life. Swimming areas need to be separated from surfing
or boating activities. Concerns with water clarity, purity,
and temperature are similar to other areas.
The twice-daily cycle of high and low tides causes tidal
currents. In some coastal areas, the main shoreline is sepa-
rated from the open ocean by a series of barrier bars and
islands enclosing shallow bays. The current in tidal channels
TIDAL CURRENT
(GOING OUT)
OCEAN
BAY


Chapter 7: Swimming Locations 65
between the islands can be strong enough to wash a human-
powered boat or a swimmer out to sea. Avoid swimming
in such areas, and be alert to changes in the strength and
direction of currents as tides wax and wane.
Longshore currents, also known as drift or lateral cur-
rents, move parallel to the shore. They will not carry a
swimmer out to sea, but they can wash an unwary person
toward areas of potential danger such as pilings or rip
currents. Buddies and safety personnel should check to
see if swimmers are drifting along the beach. If so, the
swimmers should swim directly toward shore until they
are able to wade back to the group. Swimming against
the current wastes energy.
In some cases, drift currents run in a “gutter” or trough
inside the surf line between the beach and a shallow
sandbar. Such holes can present a danger to poor swim-
mers, particularly shorter children.
Water cast upon the beach by waves must eventually
return seaward. In some areas, the water flow is first
channeled along the beach and then returned seaward in
strong, isolated currents called rips. Some rips are rela-
tively fixed in location—along the edges of a narrow bay,
for example. Others arise where a break in a sandbar pro-
vides a channel for outgoing water. Those currents will
change location as sandbars shift. Intense, temporary rips
may appear quickly in response to changing conditions,
such as a surge produced by a storm moving toward land.
Rip currents are fairly narrow and can sometimes be rec-
ognized as a strip of foamy, different-colored water that
causes a gap in breaking waves. Rip currents are danger-
ous and should be avoided. They are a contributing factor
to many ocean drownings and to most rescues made by
ocean lifeguards. At guarded beaches, flags may be used
to limit swimming to areas away from rips.
Rip currents can pull unwary swimmers into deep water
and sweep them many yards offshore. Poor swimmers may
panic and need help after they exhaust themselves trying
to swim to shore against the powerful current. Instead,
they should swim parallel to shore until they are out of the
current. Generally the distance will be short, but may be
comparable to a length or two in a pool (25 to 50 yards). In
such a situation, it helps to know restful swimming strokes.
DRIFT CURRENT


Chapter 7: Swimming Locations66
Once out of the current, the swimmer should probe with
the legs for the bottom. There may be standing depth on an
adjacent sandbar. Otherwise, the swimmer can continue to
shore outside of the rip. A discussion of rip currents should
be included in the “tailgate” review that precedes a unit
swim in any area where they are likely.
Backwash, or runback, is caused when the water cast
ashore by a wave flows seaward down the slope of the
beach. The flow reverses promptly as the next wave
approaches. Backwash is most noticeable on steep
beaches. The rushing water can make it difficult for a
person to keep his or her footing, but it isn’t normally dan-
gerous, except perhaps for a small child or an inexperi-
enced swimmer. As always, both such groups should be
closely supervised. Breaking waves combined with back-
wash may cause them distress. Backwash may have led
to the concept of people being caught in an “undertow”
and dragged under. Backwash may knock some people
off their feet and push them momentarily seaward, but it
does not suck them down and hold them underwater.
Surf is the combination of breaking waves and backwash.
Wave strength depends on offshore winds, the steepness
of the beach, and whether the tide is in or out. Waves
approaching a beach travel as swells formed by offshore
winds. If the water remains deep all the way to shore, wave
energy is not released by breaking, and surging waves can
cast a swimmer against rocks or piers. Swimmers should
avoid surging waves impinging on obstacles.
As the water depth decreases, the waves become higher
until they break. Plunging waves topple over the wave
front with a large, sudden release of energy. Such waves
are dangerous for swimmers and a common cause of
spinal injuries in the surf. Spilling waves occur when
the top of the wave tumbles down the wave front. Swim-
ming in small waves spilling on a gently sloping beach is
generally less hazardous than swimming in either large
plunging waves or waves surging on rocks.
Surging waves
Plunging waves
Spilling waves


Chapter 7: Swimming Locations 67
Swells typically break in water depths approximately
1.3 times their height. The difference in depth between
a wave trough and peak can be a significant portion of
a swimmer’s height. Swimmers seeking deeper water
against the action of waves should be cautioned against
trying to dive under a wave. The likely result is a neck or
spinal injury.
On steep beaches, the action of waves and/or tides may
produce an abrupt change in depth known as a low-tide
shelf. Nonswimmers should be isolated from such a zone
when the change in depth is the difference between
standing and swimming. That transition point will vary
with the tide as well as the height of the bather.
Access to the water on a sandy beach is straightfor-
ward, but not all shorelines have large stretches of
sand. In some areas, the surf impinges on cliffs at high
tide, with small patches of shingle (coarse pebbles) or
sand exposed at low tide. Care should be taken when
swimming at the base of a cliff during low tide to avoid
being trapped against the cliff as the tide comes in.
In other areas, stands of thick mangroves line the shoreline
and prevent access. In still other places, the shoreline is
composed of ancient rough coral. Stout footwear is needed
in that case.


Chapter 7: Swimming Locations68
Footwear can also protect against some types of marine
life that inflict stings. Rays and urchins have spines that
may be embedded in a foot if stepped on. Jellyfish and
sea anemones sting by contact with their soft tentacles.
Contact with certain types of coral will also result in
skin irritation. The result of a sting can range from mild
discomfort to a life-threatening allergic reaction.
Because of the latter, the unit supervisor should make
marine life a consideration in an emergency action
plan when swimming in the ocean. At some beaches,
warnings against jellyfish and rays will be posted. In a
few areas, kelp or other vegetation may be thick enough
to pose a hazard by impeding swimming.
Attacks by other types of marine life, such as sharks or
crocodiles, are rare in this country but not unknown.
In other countries, attacks by marine life may be more
prevalent, and stings from box jellyfish may be fatal. Seek
advice from locals when swimming in unfamiliar areas.
To establish a safe swimming area at a surf beach, first find
an area of safe, easy access away from strong currents.
Abide by any posted signs limiting use of the area. If the
unit has nonswimmers and beginners, combine them into
one group limited to an area shoreward of safety personnel
standing where waves crest no more than chest high on
the participants. The responders should be aligned with
markers on the beach that establish the lateral limits of the


Chapter 7: Swimming Locations 69
area. If each responder faces the opposite corner of the
area, they should be able to see each other and each scan
the entire area. The participants may feel more secure if
life jackets are worn.
A second rescue team, equipped with a line and a flota-
tion device, should be assigned to watch the swimmer
area. Ideally, the outer limits of the swimmer area should
be marked with anchored buoys. However, if buoys are
impractical, the swimmers should be instructed to stay
within a given distance of the guards, say 50 feet, or no
farther out than the guards are apart. A buddy check can
be called if a buddy pair strays too far out. Water depths
where the troughs of the waves are at chest height should
be adequate for a swimmer area. However, the depth at a
reasonable distance from the safety team will depend on
the slope of the bottom.
If a large troop is involved, it may be advisable in some
settings to divide the unit into smaller groups, either
by swim classifications or patrols, each with its own
supervisor, lookout, and response personnel.
Not all ocean beaches have noticeable surf, particularly in
bays. Safe Swim Defense specifics at a “non-surf” ocean
waterfront are similar to those at a lake or pond. Areas at
non-surf beaches where the water clarity approaches that
of a pool are well suited for unit swims. Such areas occur
along the carbonate platforms of the Florida coast where
the Florida National High Adventure Sea Base is located.
The water is more likely to be turbid in small bays near
the mouths of silt-laden rivers that empty into the western
Gulf of Mexico.
Swimming From Boats
There are several situations when a unit, generally small in
number, may consider swimming from a boat that is large
enough to carry the entire group. Afternoon cruises on a
pontoon boat on a local lake or a live-aboard cruise on a
large sailboat are examples. Some of the best snorkeling
sites are easier to reach by boat than from shore.
Generally, swimming from a boat should be considered
only when all members of the unit are classified as BSA
swimmers. Otherwise, the group can put ashore and
establish a conventional Safe Swim Defense area where
everyone can participate.
Swimming from a boat under way is not authorized.
Towing people on floats, boards, or skis are separate
activities covered in Chapter 26.
The boat should be anchored in an area free of underwater
obstructions, such as submerged trees, and away from boat
traffic. Ideally, the boat should be anchored in clear water
less than 12 feet in depth. If clear water is over 12 feet deep,
or if the water is turbid and exceeds 8 feet in depth, then
swimming from a boat should only be allowed if properly
fitted life jackets are worn in the water. Having everyone
wear a life jacket also precludes swimming underwater,
which is not allowed in turbid water.
The swimmer area may be defined as an approximate
distance from the boat. Somewhere around 50 to 75
feet should be sufficient. It is not necessary to deploy
anchored buoys to define the area for a small group,


Chapter 7: Swimming Locations70
but the adult supervisor should intervene if a buddy
pair abuses the guidelines by continuously pushing
the limits. Buddy checks can be used to regroup the
swimmers closer to the boat if the group begins to
disperse over too large an area.
Swimmers should be able to enter and exit the water
easily. That normally requires a boat equipped with a fixed
or removable ladder or a swim platform. Don’t neglect a
plan for rescuers to bring an unconscious person aboard.
Jumping feetfirst from the side of the boat should only
be allowed into deep water that has been checked
for obstructions.
Small swells or weak currents will swing a boat anchored
from the bow to face into the direction of water move-
ment, and will also tend to carry swimmers in the same
direction. When such forces are present, the designated
swimming area should be in front of the boat so that swim-
mers who become tired or disabled are carried toward
the boat rather than away from it. The lookout would then
be stationed at the bow. In addition, a long floating line
should be deployed from the stern to give those swept
past the boat something to grab. Swimming from boats
should not be allowed in the presence of large swells and
strong currents.
Swimming should be confined to only one direction away
from the boat, so that a lookout on the boat can observe
the entire group without turning. Ideally, neither the lookout
facing the swimmers, nor swimmers facing the boat, should
be facing into the sun.
Rescue personnel may be stationed on the boat or in a
tender craft. They should be equipped with flotation aids
and throwing devices. The distance swimmers are allowed
away from the boat may need to be specified in terms of the
length of the line in a throw bag. A practice drill at the start of
the swim will check that the safety team and the swimmers
know how to respond in the event of an emergency.
During a buddy check, swimmers need to find their
buddy and tread water in position. It is not necessary
to have everyone leave the water to determine if bud-
dies are watching each other and to check the number
in the water. A buddy check should also serve to remind
the adult supervisor to review weather conditions. Get-
ting everyone to a safe location during a thunderstorm
will obviously take more time from an anchored boat than
from a backyard pool.
Rescue equipment, personnel placement, emergency
drills, and keeping a weather eye are elements of an
emergency action plan for swimming from a boat. Emer-
gency planning also needs to consider who handles the
boat if the skipper becomes incapacitated and how to
contact the nearest emergency services, such as a lake
patrol, county sheriff’s office, or the Coast Guard. A cell
phone may be carried for emergency communication. In
coastal areas, marine radios are useful.
Safety procedures for swimming from a boat involve
elements of both Safe Swim Defense and Safety Afloat.
Emergency action plans for boating excursions are cov-
ered more thoroughly in the boating section of this text.
Distance and Competitive
Swimming in Open Water
Swimming long distances promotes physical fitness
through exercise and conditioning. The Mile Swim BSA
recognition is one such activity. Long distances may be
achieved in a pool or an established waterfront swim area
by swimming laps in accordance with Safe Swim Defense
policies. The BSA has established additional guidelines if
the distance is covered over longer stretches outside an
established swimming area:
• The environment for an open-water swim must con-
form to Safe Swim Defense guidelines regarding
hazards such as submerged trees, currents, or boat
traffic, as well as water quality, depth, and clarity.
• Each individual swimmer, or at most a buddy pair,
may be accompanied by a rowboat with two people
onboard, one skilled in controlling the boat and the

other trained in basic water rescue, equipped with
a reaching device and flotation aid, continuously
watching the swimmer(s).
• Alternatively, a closed circuit may be established
where all swimmers are constantly in reach of safety
personnel strategically positioned at fixed points on
anchored boats, the shore, or piers. Each participant
swims with a buddy, and the number and spacing
of the swimmers in the water should not exceed
the capacity of the watchers to easily count the
swimmers as they move from one zone to another.
• Some competitive swimming events, such as triathlons,
also cover long distances. Long-distance swimming
races are not approved for Cub Scouts or Boy Scouts,
but Venturers may participate in triathlon training and
competitive events. All swimming activities conducted
by Venturing crews must conform to Safe Swim Defense
guidelines. Individual Venturers may participate in
outside triathlon events sanctioned by USA Triathlon.
Guarded Public Facilities
Public swimming pools, water parks, and guarded swim
beaches have excellent safety records. Units are encour-
aged to swim in regulated areas where the facility oper-
ator provides trained lifeguards. Safe Swim Defense
application in such situations is less complicated since
the unit is no longer solely responsible for area safety
and emergency response. However, the unit leader is not
relieved of all safety concerns.
Safety records at regulated facilities are good when life-
guards quickly recognize and respond to crisis situations.
However, Safe Swim Defense guidelines generally man-
date a higher standard for crisis prevention. The proven
preventive strategies of Safe Swim Defense should be
implemented to complement nominal facility procedures.
That can be done without being obvious or obtrusive.
Even though many rescue situations arise from poor
swimming ability or health conditions, few public facilities
screen for either. Public facilities seldom have safeguards
in place to prevent poor swimmers from attempting
feats beyond their skill. Poor swimmers are seldom excluded
from deep water, and water depths may not be well marked
in natural bodies of water. When a BSA unit uses a guarded
facility, the adult supervisor remains responsible for
knowing the swimming ability of each unit member and
pointing out areas of appropriate depth for those in
different skill classifications. The supervisor should then
watch to see that such instructions are followed. Any
special safety precautions indicated by a temporary or
chronic medical condition must be observed.
The few drownings that do occur where trained lifeguards
are on duty are often blamed on lack of timely recognition
that someone is in trouble. The swimming area at a public
facility may be scanned by only a single guard who is
responsible for dozens of people. Ideally, guards are highly
skilled and motivated and closely supervised. Rarely,
a sole teenage lifeguard can become complacent or
overwhelmed and may not perform as trained. A moment
of distraction to deal with an unruly patron at a critical
time is all it takes for a drowning person to slip unnoticed to
the bottom.

Chapter 7: Swimming Locations74
To increase the margin of safety, Safe Swim Defense
suggests a much larger guard-to-swimmer ratio than
mandated by most state regulations. The unit leader need
not assign unit personnel to act as guards to maintain the
recommended ratio, but should act as a lookout wher-
ever the unit swims, particularly if the facility is crowded.
Additional surveillance is provided by the buddy system.
Although it may be impractical to conduct buddy checks
at a public facility, each member of the unit should still
be assigned a buddy and given the responsibility to notify
guard personnel immediately if their buddy needs help.
At Cub Scouting events where parents participate with
their children, parent and Cub Scout should be paired
as buddies.
At the end of a session at a public facility, the unit leader is
responsible for ensuring that everyone is accounted for.
A time and a meeting place should be given to everyone
at the start of the activity. Buddies should be told that they
are responsible to make sure their partners are present
on time. Generally, swim periods should not last more
than an hour.
At guarded public facilities, the unit is still responsible
for medical screening, ability groups, the buddy system,
discipline, and supervision.
At large water parks where several activity features
are spread over a large area, unit leaders should base
supervision on age. Den leaders should accompany
Cub Scouts from area to area, serve as lookouts, and
assemble everyone before moving en masse to the next
feature. Although it may not be practical for the entire
den to line up together for each activity, buddies should
be in line together. Scoutmasters should ask patrol
leaders to keep patrols together and to report together as
a patrol at the end of the session. Venturers may proceed
on their own from one activity to another so long as they
remain with their buddies.
During major holidays, public swimming facilities and
beaches near major urban areas can be extremely
crowded. Units should avoid planning trips to such
locations at those times.
Recap
Safe Swim Defense defines BSA policies on swimming
activities. Those policies offer the conscientious unit
leader effective risk-management tools based on known
risk factors and effective preventive measures. Limitations
on certain activities should not be viewed as stumbling
blocks; rather, policies and guidelines are best described
as stepping-stones toward safe and enjoyable adventures.
However, every possible contingency may not be cov-
ered with a hard-and-fast rule, and rules are poor sub-
stitutes for experience. A responsible adult leader, who
understands his or her responsibility and the risk factors
addressed by various policies, can exercise discretion
regarding certain procedures while maintaining safety.
Ultimately, each leader must personally decide if he or
she is sufficiently experienced and well-informed to make
the rational decisions expected of a qualified supervisor.


Basic Swimming Skills
An informed unit leader for an aquatics activity has several reasons for reviewing basic swimming skills, such as
administering swim classification tests, helping with advancement, and as essential components for in-water rescues.
While rescues of distraught swimmers can often be accomplished without entering the water, the ability to respond
effectively to some drowning situations requires reasonable proficiency in basic swimming stokes such as the crawl,
breaststroke, elementary backstroke, and sidestroke. The first two are used to approach a victim in the water; the
second two to pull an unconscious victim to safety. Effective emergency response also requires knowing how to reach
the bottom from the surface. The basic components of those skills are reviewed here. Additional information may be
found in the Swimming merit badge pamphlet.

Chapter 8: Basic Swimming Skills76
Crawl Stroke
The front crawl combines a relaxed flutter kick with a
rotary arm motion and rhythmic breathing. It is the fastest
stroke but can consume considerable energy. The stroke
is most efficient if the head remains supported by the
water. The body is rotated and the head turned to the side
to inhale, and rotated down to exhale. Power is improved
if the lower arm is bent and swept across the chest rather
than rotated in a vertical arc. A slight glide is possible if
the forward arm action is delayed slightly while the rear
arm recovers in the air.
Most of the power comes from the arms, but the kick
should also generate forward motion.
The crawl provides a fast approach during water rescue,
and is often modified with the head up for that application.
However, a head-up crawl with the head slung from side to
side without rhythmic breathing is a sign of a poor swim-
mer (see picture below). Most people swimming in that
manner lack the stamina to go far. A head-down version
is preferred for the BSA swimmer test but is not required.
SIDE VIEW FRONT VIEW


Chapter 8: Basic Swimming Skills 77
Breaststroke
The breaststroke is an easy, energy-conserving way to
swim in a prone position. Coordination is a key to learning
the stroke since the arms and legs do not provide power
at the same time. The stroke begins with the arms and
legs extended and the head in the water. The arms bend
at the elbows and sweep down and back to shoulder
level while pulling the body forward. At the same time,
the head is lifted for a breath and the feet are drawn to
the hips. The arms are then extended forward as the feet
lead the knees in a circular motion that generates power
and returns the legs to an extended position. To conserve
energy, the body is allowed to glide in the prone position
before beginning another stroke.
The racing version of the stroke omits the glide but
is much less efficient. It takes a conditioned athlete to
maintain a race pace for long distances, but even an
out-of-shape casual swimmer should be able to swim
long distances using the restful version.
The head may remain out of the water to provide a view
during recreational swimming or a water-rescue approach.
The breaststroke is a good alternative to the front crawl
for the BSA swimmer classification test.
SIDE VIEW FRONT VIEW


Chapter 8: Basic Swimming Skills78
Elementary Backstroke
The elementary backstroke begins with the arms at the
side and the legs together. The whip kick is started by
slowly lowering the heels beneath the knees. The ankles
are then rotated outward of the knees and returned to the
start position in a rapid, continuous circular motion. The
knees separate naturally.
At the same time the heels are lowered, the arms are
brought slowly along the chest and extended outward
at shoulder level. The hands and forearms push water
toward the feet at the same time that the legs are making
the circular “whipping” action.
The arms and the legs provide power at the same time
and the body glides in the start position. A long glide is
an essential element of the stroke when used to swim
long distances.
The kick by itself is used in various water-rescue situations.
Raising the head and bending at the waist are common
mistakes that distort the body position and make the
stroke less efficient. Bending at the waist sometimes
results from lifting the knees.
The elementary backstroke is the model of a restful
backstroke for the BSA swimmer classification test.
SIDE VIEW TOP VIEW


Chapter 8: Basic Swimming Skills 79
Sidestroke
The sidestroke begins with the body on its side, with legs
together, the lower arm extended, and the upper arm resting
along the chest.
The sidestroke uses a scissors kick in which the heels are
first tucked behind the body. The top leg is then extended
forward and the bottom leg back. Power is generated
when the legs are snapped back to a trailing position.
As the legs are tucked, the lower arm bends at the elbow
and the hand and forearm pull the body through the water.
The lower arm is extended forward as the legs complete
the kick. Meanwhile, the upper hand is brought toward
the chin and thrusts backward at the same time the legs
are brought together.
The stroke uses a glide to conserve energy. Breathing is
natural since the head remains out of the water. Progress
is easily measured with a view to the side, but the forward
view is restricted.
The upper arm can be used to grasp a flotation aid while
the lower arm and legs are used to tow the device and
a victim during a rescue.
Good swimmers can swim the stroke on either side but
often find that the kick is inverted; that is, the top leg
goes back rather than forward. That tendency can be
overcome, but power is generated either way.
The sidestroke is a good alternative to the front crawl for
the BSA swimmer classification test.


Chapter 8: Basic Swimming Skills80
Feetfirst Surface Dive
The feetfirst surface dive allows a person treading water
to descend vertically. A scissors kick is used to lift the
chest clear of the water, at the same time the arms are
pushed downward from an extended position. The legs
are straightened below the water as the weight of the
torso out of the water drives the body down. During the
descent, the arms are lifted from the sides to provide
additional downward force. The arms should not be lifted
too quickly; they should push against the water rather
than break the surface.
The feetfirst surface dive is used to check the depth when
setting up a swimmers area and is the preferred method
for retrieving a submerged victim in poor visibility.


Chapter 8: Basic Swimming Skills 81
Headfirst Surface Dive
From a prone position, move forward with the arm pull
of a breaststroke, and then scoop downward with the
arms while bending at the waist and lifting the legs in the
air. The weight of the legs above the water provides the
force to descend. The headfirst surface dive is known as
a pike if the legs are kept straight the entire time and as a
tuck if the legs are first bent and then extended vertically.
During the descent, the body should be in a streamlined
position with the legs together and the arms extended
in front of the head. An arm pull can be used to reach
greater depths.
The headfirst surface dive is used to retrieve a submerged
victim in clear water.


Chapter 8: Basic Swimming Skills82
Nonswimmer Instruction
Safe Swim Defense is easier to administer if everyone in
the unit is a good swimmer, as defined by the BSA swim-
mer classification test. Also, nonswimmers and begin-
ners lack recreational and advancement opportunities
until their swimming skills improve. Scouting strives to
safely provide those opportunities to everyone.
One recognized means to improve swimming ability is to
enroll a child in a small class taught by an experienced
swimming instructor. A den is well served if the den leader
can arrange swimming lessons for the group. Scouts
attending summer camp are typically provided swimming
instruction at all levels. For various reasons, such options
are not always available on a timely basis. Unit leaders
who are good swimmers experienced in dealing with
youth can jump-start the process with a little guidance.
Sometimes the best instructor is someone the child
knows and trusts—e.g., a parent, working one-on-one—
as opposed to a strange adult in the midst of equally
unfamiliar, and perhaps insensitive, peers.
The following material outlines a step-by-step process
to teach the skills required for a child to advance from
nonswimmer to beginner. The same steps are applicable
to just about everyone, regardless of age or comfort
level in the water. However, both those factors will
influence instructional details and how quickly the
person will progress.
Attention spans and motivations for a 6-year-old are
very different from those of a 16-year-old just learn-
ing to swim. The first benefits from games the second
would find insulting. The first may expect to be held in the
water, whereas the second may shy away from physical
contact. However, the same progression of skills is
essential to both.
Tiger age (that is, first grade) is an ideal time to begin
stroke instruction. Many toddlers are introduced to the
water at very young ages, but those programs familiar-
ize the child with the water more than they teach skills
sufficient for the youth to independently move safely and
confidently in the water. It is one thing for a child to ride
a tricycle in the yard; another for a child to ride a bicycle
to school. The swimming instructor of a young child needs
to emphasize safety at all times. A child who respects the
water may be safer than one who enjoys the water without
realizing the risks.
Ideally, a Tiger should be taught basic swimming
skills along with a buddy of similar ability. That intro-
duces the buddy system as a basic safety rule, and the
companionship should make the learning process more
pleasurable. On the other hand, a 16-year-old leery of the
water may prefer to work with the instructor alone.
The time it takes to progress through the steps probably
depends more on comfort level in the water than on age.
Both the 6-year-old and the 16-year-old should progress
rapidly if they are already comfortable in the water. The
first few steps establish that comfort level, and in some
cases may quickly be set aside. A few hours may be all
it takes to improve enough to complete the beginner test.
However, it may take a person who has learned to fear
the water several hours to move away from the side and
put his or her face in the water.
The initial stages should not be rushed. Learners should
be encouraged to progress at their own pace according
to their abilities, not those of someone else in a class.
Any time a pupil is reluctant to try something new, the
instructor should consider backing up a step. Patience
is required to teach children to swim, particularly those
apprehensive of the water.
A conscientious and understanding adult comfortable in the
water can use the following steps to teach basic swimming
skills. When introducing a new skill, the instructor should
explain the procedure as simply as possible, demonstrate
the skill, and then have the buddies try it, either one at a time
or together as appropriate. At the start of any new period of
instruction, participants should be asked to review the skills
they learned during the previous session.


Chapter 8: Basic Swimming Skills 83
1. Orientation and Adjustment to Water
Although many nonswim-
mers will be ready to enter
the water immediately
to begin playing and
learning, some will be
timid or cautious, particu-
larly on the first day or if
the water is cool, turbid,
or unfamiliar. For this
reason and to minimize
physical discomfort, the
initial adjustment process should be gradual and
deliberate. (After the first session, the adjustment routine
may be quicker and more spontaneous.) The instructor
should begin the first instructional period by entering
shallow water and facing participants who are either
seated on the pool’s edge or standing on the beach at the
water’s edge a few feet from the instructor. With their
buddies, participants should dangle their feet in the water
where they can bend and reach water with their hands,
or they should walk into the water down steps or on a
beach until they are approximately knee-deep. (If the
instructional area is not a pool, the nature of the bottom
should be carefully explained before learners are asked
to enter the water. A reassuring comment on turbid or
discolored water also is important.) Imitating the
instructor, the participants dip, splash, and rub water on
their necks, faces, arms, and upper bodies. This exercise
will let the instructor quickly identify those who are
uneasy and will need special assistance in overcoming
reluctance about the water. If all are willing and
enthusiastic, this opening exercise to each lesson
may be advanced quickly to a brief bob and splash.
2. Breathing
The most basic and
important skill in
swimming is breath
control—when and
how to inhale and
exhale. Have the
buddies wade
waist-deep in the
water with the instructor. The instructor demonstrates
cupping the hands, holding water to the face, and blowing
into the water through the nose. Participants should imi-
tate and practice. Next, have participants imitate the
instructor as he or she bends forward at the waist with
hands on knees, exhales through the mouth and nose
toward the water, turns to the side, and inhales through the
mouth. This rhythm is quickly learned, and the next step is
to repeat with the face in the water while exhaling. After
exhaling slowly through the mouth and nose for three to
four seconds, the pupil rotates the head to one side until
the mouth is clear of the water. With the mouth clear, the
pupil takes a breath and rotates the face back into the
water to exhale. Practice until the pupil can comfortably
perform rhythmic breathing 10 to 15 times without hesita-
tion. (In clear water, encourage participants to keep their
eyes open. Even in muddy or turbid water, they should
learn to open their eyes when inhaling to avoid disorienta-
tion.) One problem that could develop is that nonswimmers
may want to raise their heads before turning to breathe.
Demonstrate turning the head with the ear in the water,
then the nose in the water. (Help the participants practice
by reminding them:
ear-nose . . . ear-
nose . . . ear-nose.)
Be sure they blow
air out through the
nostrils when exhal-
ing in the water; this
keeps water out of
the nose.
Next, have buddies
practice the see-
saw in chest-deep
water. To do this,
have them join hands and face each other. One buddy
takes a breath, goes below the surface, and remains
there for two to three seconds while the other buddy
remains above the surface. As the first buddy exhales and
comes up, the other goes down for two to three seconds.
This continues in a rhythmic pattern. Keep the
participants working on this until able to do it 15 to 20
times without stopping.


Chapter 8: Basic Swimming Skills84
3. Body Position and Buoyancy
Some nonswim-
mers may be
reluctant to try
floating or other
skills because
they do not know
how to recover
their footing. First,
demonstrate how to bob. Have the pupils stand in chest-
deep water with their forearms lying on the surface. Have
them feel the upward thrust caused by pushing their arms
down. Next, have them push down while lifting their feet
from the bottom. To recover, they simply straighten their
legs. Repeat with faces in the water between extended
arms. To recover, they push down with their arms, lift their
head, and straighten their legs. Once both buddies are
comfortable lifting their feet from the bottom, they are
ready to learn buoyancy using the barrel or jellyfish float.
Demonstrate floating by taking a deep breath, lean-
ing forward, and holding the knees against the chest
with the face down in the water. The instructor can also
demonstrate the importance of breath control in floating
by beginning a barrel float, then slowly exhaling and sink-
ing while staying in the floating position. While practicing
the barrel float, participants also have an opportunity to
practice their recovery to a standing position. After they
have practiced the barrel float and discovered their own
buoyancy, they are ready to begin learning the basic
swimming stroke components and coordination.
4. Prone Float and Glide
The prone float may be learned either holding to the side
of a pool at arm’s length or holding the hands of a buddy
standing in waist-deep water. An assistant instructor is
handy to demonstrate the buddy assist if that method
is used.
Buddies face each other in waist-deep water while hold-
ing hands at arm’s length. One buddy takes a deep breath,
puts his or her face in the water, and then eases the legs
back and straight behind until the body is extended and
relaxed. After a few seconds in this position, the hands
are released and the floater recovers his or her footing by
pulling the knees forward, pressing the hands down, and
lifting the head. (The recovery should be slow and easy.)
The instructor should help each participant personally
with the first attempt if there is any reluctance. Practice
until both buddies are comfortable holding the float for
several seconds.
The next step is
to demonstrate and
practice plunging and
coasting (the prone
glide). This skill is
nothing more than a
moving prone float.
The instructor should
first demonstrate the
skill, including a proper recovery to the standing position.
In waist-deep water, have the participants squat slightly
and lean forward with arms extended and hands together
until the shoulders are below the surface. Then have them
take a breath, place their faces in the water, and push for-
ward off the bottom. (Be sure to have participants push


Chapter 8: Basic Swimming Skills 85
toward or across shallow water, never toward deep
water.) For the reluctant participant, the instructor should
hold his or her hands and walk quickly backward for
several repetitions until he or she becomes familiar with
the movement. Practice until each buddy can glide
comfortably for over a body length.
5. Back Float and Glide
The instructor demonstrates the back float in waist-deep
water by squatting down as if to sit on a chair. When the
shoulders are just below the surface, the instructor
extends the arms to the side just below the surface with
the palms up. Next, the instructor takes a deep breath
and tilts the head well back with the chin up and the ears
in the water. The legs are slowly extended and relaxed as
the body bobs and settles into a natural floating position
with the arms extended above the head with palms up on
the water. (Some will float high on the water with hips and
legs near the surface; others will float with only their face
and portions of their chests breaking the surface.) As
with the prone float, the back float demonstration should
include an easy recovery to the standing position.
As participants make their first attempts to float on their
backs, the instructor or assistant should provide some sup-
port under their backs and hips, not lifting but simply bal-
ancing the body at the buoyant level. Physical contact is
important in this exercise to overcome natural insecurity
about falling backward in the water. Once the participant
has relaxed and is floating, the support is withdrawn. This
withdrawal should not be sudden or unanticipated, however.
When the participants have learned the back float, they
can be taught a back glide. Have them squat down and
lean back with arms out, as if beginning the back float,
and then push off gently with the feet as the arms are
swept down to the sides with palms in. This skill should
be demonstrated with an easy recovery at the end of the
glide. Watch the position of the participant’s head. If it
is too far back, water may wash over the face. A raised
head will cause the body to sink.
6. Flutter Kick
Demonstrate the flutter kick in a prone position while
holding onto the side of the pool or supported by a buddy.
Keep the toes slightly pointed, the ankles and knees
relaxed but straight, and kick from the hips. Kick slowly
and fluidly. Buddies can practice at the edge of the pool
(a ladder may provide a good anchor if the pool edge is
difficult to grasp) or while being towed slowly by the
instructor wading backward. Kickboards are also useful.
Once the participants learn the general motion, the best
way to practice is with the prone glide. Have them begin
their glide and then add the flutter kick. Challenge each
buddy to go farther than the time before. Emphasize
rhythm and distance, not speed. Some participants chop
when they kick, bending the leg at the knee. Others will
kick on the top of the water. Stress kicking from the hip
with the legs underwater.


Chapter 8: Basic Swimming Skills86
7. Arm Movement
The arm pull is first demonstrated and practiced alone
and then added to the prone glide. To practice the basic
skill, have the participant stand in chest-deep water and
bend forward slightly, practicing the arm movement
slowly and accurately without losing balance. Start with
one arm extended and the other along the thigh. The
extended arm is pulled backward near the centerline of
the body, then bent at the elbow as the hand clears the
water and swings forward again. The other arm moves
similarly, but in opposition. The hand enters first, in front
of the shoulder. The palm of the hand may be slightly
cupped but should be relaxed and comfortable. The
power of the stroke comes from pressing backward with
the forearm as well as the hand.
After getting the feel of the stroke while standing, partici-
pants should continue to refine the motion while walking
forward. Next add the arm stroke to a prone glide, without
a kick, with pupils stopping when out of breath. Practice
until four or five arm rotations can be done easily.
Next demonstrate breathing to one side while doing the
arm stroke. Let the buddies choose whichever side they
want. The head is turned to the side with the ear in the
water, as in step 2, as the arm on that side is pulled beyond
the head. All of the individual elements of the front crawl
are now in place.
8. Coordination
Demonstrate the complete stroke, and then let the bud-
dies work on coordination, which is gained only with
practice. Start with a prone glide with a kick and then add
the arm motion. It may be necessary to back up to refine
individual elements until the components work well
together. Don’t rush this step but provide enthusiastic
encouragement tempered by patience. The instructor
should stress the ease of the stroke, not speed. The com-
bined motion should be easy, relaxed, and streamlined.
Concentrate first on form, and then practice for longer
distances. The next two steps can be introduced at this
stage, but continue to work on coordination and distance
in shallow water until the buddies can easily swim at
least 25 feet without stopping.
9. Turning Over
Once participants have learned the crawl stroke and are
able to do a back float and back glide, they should learn
how to turn over from front to back and from back to front.
This is a useful safety skill, enabling a swimmer to rest
on his or her back when they begin to tire, and then to
resume the crawl stroke when rested.
To turn from the crawl stroke position onto the back, the
swimmer lowers one shoulder and turns the head in the
opposite direction. To turn over while swimming on the back,
the swimmer lowers one shoulder and turns the head in the
same direction. Although explanation and demonstration of
these turnover maneuvers will be helpful, participants will
learn quickest by practicing and experimenting with the
concepts of “roll over and float” and “roll over and swim.”
Despite the apparent simplicity of this specific instruction,
the instructor should not omit it, and participants should
practice these maneuvers in shallow water before attempt-
ing to swim in water over the head in depth.
10. Turns, Reverses, Stops, and Starts
Some skills are not particularly significant when swimming
in shallow water where footing is always available. But the
ability to stop and restart swimming, to reverse direction,
and to turn while swimming is of critical importance when
swimming in deep water. (Recall that the beginner classi-
fication test requires a stop and sharp turn.) To stop while
swimming the crawl stroke, the swimmer simply stops kick-
ing and raises their head while pushing down and slightly
forward with the arms. A reverse after stopping can be
done in one quick motion by sweeping both arms in the
same direction across the front of the body while turning
the head and shoulders in the opposite direction. Starting a
stroke in deep water is accomplished by pressing the arms
down from the surface of the water and back alongside the
body while leaning forward, putting the face in the water,
and beginning the flutter kick. This planes the body into the
prone glide position for the crawl stroke to begin. To turn
while swimming the crawl, the swimmer sweeps wide with
the arm stroke on the side opposite the turn and reaches out
in the direction of the turn with the other arm.


Chapter 8: Basic Swimming Skills 87
Practice all of these skills in chest-deep water until the
pupils are proficient. The buddies may then be gradu-
ally introduced to water over the head. For example, in
a small uncrowded pool, they may start in shallow water,
swim to the deep end, stop by holding the side, and then
return to standing depth. Later, they can turn rather than
stop. (A reach pole is an excellent safety device to have
on hand once the buddies are ready to venture into deep
water. It should be positioned where easily accessible,
but unobtrusive.)
11. Jump Entry Into Deep Water
An important part of learning to swim is mastering the
skills involved in deepwater entries. To teach a simple
jump entry, have the participant stand at the pool or
dock edge where the water will be chest-deep. The pupil
should bend slightly at the knees and hop forward as if
trying to land with both feet together on the surface of the
water. Arms should be extended forward with the body
leaning slightly forward from the waist. Once the buddies
are comfortable with the jump, move to shoulder-deep
water and have the pupils lean forward and begin swim-
ming as they come up. The participants should jump away
from the side, rather than try to land close enough to grab
hold. Progress to slightly deeper water until the partici-
pant is ready for the initial jump into water over the head.
By this stage, the buddies should have practiced swim-
ming over short sections of deep water. However, they
may still be apprehensive about their first jump into deep
water. If they haven’t done so before, let the buddies slip
into the deep end one at a time, hold to the side, take a
breath, and submerge. Then repeat without holding the
side. If they are not comfortable letting their head go
under water in the deep end, they are not ready for a jump
from the side into deep water.
Stroke Refinement
While an excellent milestone, the ability to complete the
BSA beginner classification test is just the first step to
becoming safe, comfortable, and proficient in the water.
Anyone working toward or beyond the beginner level will
benefit from frequent opportunities to practice their skills.
For all ages, learning though recreation is more enjoyable
than mechanical repetition. Nonswimmers and beginners
will progress simply by being allowed to play in the water
(under safe supervision, of course). However, advance-
ment to the swimmer level and beyond is most easily
accomplished through instruction by an experienced
instructor. The American Red Cross, the YMCA, and vari-
ous parks and recreation departments offer professional
instruction for all levels and age groups. The BSA local
council aquatics committee will be able to assist unit lead-
ers with contacting volunteers in those organizations. Boy
Scouts can increase their skills by working on First Class
rank and Swimming merit badge requirements at summer
camp, during special district winter aquatics programs, or
by contacting a counselor through their Scoutmaster.
BSA swimming programs emphasize early mastery of rest-
ful strokes. A person with a restful elementary backstroke
should be able to swim for long distances in warm water,
even in less-than-perfect form. However, a person whose
only option is a poorly executed crawl will need to be a
well-conditioned athlete to cover anywhere near the same
distance. A restful backstroke or breaststroke with a glide
doesn’t take much energy, and uses the legs for much of
the power. A hasty crawl, particularly with the head slung
from side to side, takes a lot of energy, and much of the
effort comes from the arms. The difference is similar to that
between walking and running. Most people can walk for
long distances on flat ground without breathing heavily and
having to stop to rest. Those same people will not be able
to run full-out for long. Running, and swimming the crawl,
simply takes more energy, and most folks aren’t trained
marathon runners or competitive swimmers.


Chapter 8: Basic Swimming Skills88
The learn-to-swim programs of several organizations
place an early emphasis on competitive strokes and teach
those before restful strokes. Anyone completing their full
course progressions will emerge an excellent swimmer
proficient in all the basic skills. Unfortunately, while many
parents enroll their children yearly in the first few levels,
fewer and fewer continue to the higher levels where the
restful strokes are mastered. Instruction should continue
until basic strokes such as the elementary backstroke, the
breaststroke, and the sidestroke are learned sufficiently
that distances are easily measured in hundreds of yards,
rather than a few tens of feet. Surveys reported by the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control suggest that a large
percentage of Americans fall far short of that goal.


Water Rescue
The goal of Safe Swim Defense is to eliminate the need for water rescue. Even so, the adult supervisor must ensure that
appropriate emergency response will be implemented, should the need arise. Efficient and safe water rescue requires
properly equipped and trained personnel.
If the adult supervisor lacks a water-safety background, an easy way to provide adequate protection is to conduct unit
swimming only where trained lifeguards are provided by a facility or tour operator. Although that is certainly a reasonable
and prudent approach, it limits the opportunities available to the unit. The alternative is for unit leaders to acquire the
necessary knowledge for the unit to function safely using its own resources. Many do. Required training in Safe Swim
Defense only allows unit leaders to gauge their level of preparation; it seldom provides much physical training in the
necessary skills. BSA Aquatics Supervision: Swimming and Water Rescue covers the skills presented in this section and
is recommended for leaders conducting swimming activities where trained lifeguards are not on duty.

Chapter 9: Water Rescue90
Those who have completed BSA Lifeguard training are
also ideally suited to assist with safe unit swims. Unit
members who have completed lifeguard training from
organizations such as the American Red Cross, the
United States Lifesaving Association, and the YMCA are
also valuable resources, but they should still receive Safe
Swim Defense training. Such organizations assume that
the lifeguards they train will be employed at an estab-
lished facility. They may not include instruction in how
to establish a temporary safe swim area, how to perform
rescues with a range of equipment, or how to limit risk
using ability groups and the buddy system. Safe Swim
Defense addresses those gaps.
BSA Lifeguard and lifeguard training programs offered
by other organizations are designed to meet regulatory
demands for paid, professional lifeguards. BSA employ-
ees who supervise swimming activities at Scout sum-
mer camps are subject to such standards. Although the
material in this section is consistent with the training
received by professional lifeguards, it does not constitute
a complete lifeguard training program. Training for BSA
Swimming and Water Rescue is designed to prepare
the volunteer unit leader to conduct safe unit swims in
situations where all elements of Safe Swim Defense
are in place, not to serve as a professional lifeguard in
other situations.
Victim Recognition
The first step in a rescue is recognizing that someone
needs help. The need may be obvious. You may observe
someone dive into shallow water and then float facedown
motionless at the surface. But not all drowning situations
are that dramatic or easy to spot. A child who appears to
be playing may actually be in serious trouble.
It is important to note that not everyone in difficulty
will call for help or seem to be struggling.
People in danger of drowning can be divided into differ-
ent classes or categories based on their condition. In
turn, basic rescue techniques are influenced by those
conditions. Different classification schemes are possible,
including distressed versus drowning, conscious versus
unconscious, active versus passive. The labels are less
important than identifying specific behaviors and their
effects on rescue technique. Several such categories
are discussed below. Note that these are guidelines,
not absolutes. An actual victim might not exactly fit the
descriptions and may slide from one type into another
over the course of a rescue. In crowded, murky water it
may be difficult to tell one type from another. Basically,
you need to identify anyone unable to control their own
movements in the water and decide whether to respond
by providing a support device or performing a contact
rescue. The time you have in which to respond will also
depend on victim characteristics.

Chapter 9: Water Rescue 91
Tired Swimmer
A tired swimmer may ask for
help. He or she might be swim-
ming ineffectually in short
bursts, proceeding slowly with
a weak stroke, clinging to a
boundary line, or trying to float
on their back. They lack, or
think they lack, the energy to
make it to shore and probably
only need encouragement and a helping hand. Such a
situation may arise during a
swim classification test when
a weak swimmer becomes
fatigued. A tired swimmer is
calm, should reply to ques-
tions, and should cooperate
with the assist. Because the
tired swimmer is not at imme-
diate risk of submersion, the
rescuer may deliberate momentarily to choose between
direct assistance and simple encouragement.
Distressed Swimmer
A swimmer in distress is
normally vertical in the water
and exhibits various degrees
of anxiety or panic. He or she
may be a poor swimmer who
has exceeded his or her
capabilities. A poor swimmer
caught in a rip current may
first become exhausted
swimming against the current, and then become fright-
ened. Acute medical problems such as a cramp or a
stroke may also incapacitate a conscious swimmer and
necessitate a rescue. By definition, the distressed swim-
mer is no longer making any progress but is still able to
struggle enough to keep their head out of the water. The
swimmer may call or wave
for help. If they were able to
level off and apply the same
energy to their swimming
effort, they might be able to
reach safety on their own.
The swimmer may act on
clear instructions from a res-
cuer and reach for equipment as it is presented. How-
ever, such a victim may not be rational and could grab a
rescuer. Contact should be avoided. The longer a dis-
tressed swimmer remains in trouble, the more likely it is
that they will submerge. Prompt support is needed.
Active Drowning Victim
An actively drowning
person is also distressed
or distraught. An inten-
tional attempt to remain
at the surface — not
mental state — is the
distinguishing character-
istic between a “dis-
tressed swimmer” and
an “active drowning victim.” The second term is used to
indicate a conscious person with no deliberate control of
motion. Such a victim lacks the ability to remain at the
surface and will generally submerge in less than a minute.
They are unable to call or wave for help and must be
recognized by their facial expression and inadequate
movement. The victim usually is vertical in the water and
may have their head thrown back with face upward. Arms
are extended to the side pressing down or flapping. There is
no effective leg movement. The head may bob below the
surface. This is known as the classic or instinctive
drowning response, and may resemble someone playing in
the water. Although conscious
and very aware of their
situation, such victims cannot
respond to commands or reach
for nearby equipment. How-
ever, such victims may grasp
an object, such as a flotation
aid or an unwary rescuer, that
makes sufficient contact.
Unaided, a poor swimmer in distress may progress to the
actively drowning stage. Other victims may immediately show
such behavior. This is particularly true of nonswimmers who
have never supported themselves in deep water. A nonswim-
mer stepping off a submerged ledge will be unable to move
a few feet to shallow water. A young nonswimmer knocked
off an air mattress will be unable to reach for it and may sub-
merge in only 20 seconds. Speed in rescue is essential. (Such
possibilities reinforce the need for identifying nonswimmers,
providing close supervision to limit their activities to shallow
water, and teaching them simple swimming skills.)


Chapter 9: Water Rescue92
Unconscious Victim
People can lose con-
sciousness in the water
from a variety of causes.
Unaided, the active
drowning victim will soon
lose consciousness and
become a passive drown-
ing victim. Immersion in
cold water can result in
progressive loss of ability.
That will slowly lead to unconsciousness even if the per-
son is wearing a flotation device. Other swimmers may
become unconscious with little or no warning as a result of
a diving injury, heart attack, stroke, seizure, drunkenness,
or drug reaction.
An unconscious victim may
float facedown at the sur-
face or, more often, sink
partway, or all of the way,
to the bottom. Speed in res-
cue is critical, both in mak-
ing contact and also while
moving the person to safety.
Breathing will stop and
must be restarted as soon as possible if the victim is to
survive. Because an unconscious victim cannot grasp a
rescue aid, some type of physical contact will be required
during a rescue. A person who has lost consciousness
in the water will always need medical evaluation. EMS
should be summoned at the same time the rescue effort
is started.
Injured Victim
A water rescue can become
even more complex if the
victim is injured. Diving into
shallow water or being struck
by surfboards can cause head
and spinal injuries. Cuts and
broken bones can result from
boat collisions, water-skiers
hitting objects, cars entering
the water, boats capsizing in rapids, or a swimmer being
cast against pilings by the surf. Burns can occur from
gasoline explosions on motorboats. Fishermen might be
entangled in hooks. Painful stings may result from
encounters with marine life. In all such situations, gen-
eral first aid rules apply: Treat the most serious condition
first, do no further harm, and quickly summon advanced
help if needed. In water rescues, the most serious condi-
tion is likely to be lack of breathing. However, standard
rescue techniques for a person who is not breathing may
worsen a spinal injury.
A safe swimming area, com-
bined with supervision and
discipline, should preclude
injuries during unit swims.
Nevertheless, a headfirst
dive into shallow water takes
only a brief lapse in judg-
ment. The unit leader should
be aware of ways to stabilize
a victim of neck or spinal injury until EMS arrives.
Endangered Swimmer
The above classifications are
based on a victim’s lack or loss
of swimming ability. One more
category is needed to address
situations when a competent
swimmer faces serious diffi-
culties. A capsized canoeist
caught in a cold, fast current is
one such situation. A kayaker
pinned against a rock is another. Ocean currents can sweep a
swimmer out to sea. Fast-rising tides against a cliff face can
catch a hiker off guard. Fishermen can be swept off jetties by
abnormally high waves. Flash floods can trap motorists in
their cars. The situations can vary greatly and so will rescue
responses. In some cases, the victim can make it to shore
without aid and the rescuer’s job becomes one of follow-up
support, first aid, and transportation. In others, assistance can
be provided from shore. In still others, the only safe option is to
immediately seek aid from a trained rescue squad with spe-
cial gear. (This category is
included for completeness: it
should not be a concern at a
safe unit swim site.) Techniques
for assisting capsized boaters
will be discussed under the
headings for various craft in the
next section.


Chapter 9: Water Rescue 93
Rescue Techniques
Safe, effective rescue of a person from the water is easier
with prior training and appropriate equipment aids. At a unit
swim, the adult supervisor is responsible for ensuring that
adequate rescue equipment is available, and that assigned
rescue personnel know how to use it. Preparation needs
to include three types of victims: conscious victims who
will grasp a rescue device, unconscious or nonresponsive
victims who cannot, and victims of spinal injury whose
movements must be minimized.
For conscious victims, effective rescue response means
finding the easiest way to provide them with support.
Victims can be handed a rescue aid from the side, thrown
a rescue aid, or have a rescue aid taken to them by boat
or swimmer. Reach, throw, row, go is the mnemonic
for those options. Reaching assists from poolside, dock, or
boat are normally the easiest, followed by throwing assists.
If neither of those techniques is viable, then a swimmer
can push a float or carry a line to the victim. Contact with
a conscious, active victim is seldom necessary. However,
recall that those displaying the classic drowning response
will not be able to reach for an object that is placed nearby;
the equipment aid, but not the rescuer, must be placed in
contact with the victim.
An unconscious victim, or someone suffering a seizure or
other incapacitating medical condition, will not be able to
grasp a rescue device. Contact rescues, which may be
nothing more than grasping the victim from the side of a
pool, cannot be eliminated. Several techniques, with and
without equipment, are available to move an unconscious
victim to safety and will be discussed in the following
material. Rescuer-to-victim contact is also necessary to
aid someone with a spinal injury.
All rescues end with removing the victim from the water and
providing appropriate aftercare. Details again depend on
whether the victim is conscious and responsive, nonrespon-
sive or unconscious, or has a suspected spinal injury.
The safety of the rescuer is a major factor in all emergency
situations, including a potential drowning. Water rescues
in certain “lifesaving” situations are inherently dangerous,
such as those encountered by swift-water rescue teams
or Coast Guard rescue swimmers. In a lifesaving situation,
a rescuer may face an unsafe area with only makeshift
equipment and no assistance from others trained in water
safety. The appropriate response in such situations may
be to go for help. In a lifeguarding situation, the area is
safe and well-known, appropriate equipment is at hand,
and trained backup is available. Some people do drown
in futile attempts to save others in “safe” locations such
as pools, but the would-be rescuers are usually frantic
friends or relatives with no training whose swimming skills
are little better than those of the person in distress. Such
double drownings demonstrate that the potential risk of
approaching a struggling victim is not to be taken lightly.
However, in the controlled environment that should exist
at a unit swim, there is little risk to a rescuer who follows
the procedures described here. Contact with an active
victim is avoided by using flotation aids or other devices.
Although contact may be needed with a victim who is
unable to grasp a rescue device, such a victim is also
unlikely to grasp a rescuer.

Chapter 9: Water Rescue94
Reaching Rescues
Reaching rescues are safe, simple, and effective. They
can be used for all types of victims. Many drownings
occur close to safety. That’s because the poor swimmer
often gets into trouble as soon as they enter water over
the head. That is likely to be close to the edge of a pool
or dock. A rescuer at such a location simply needs to lie
down, extend a hand, and pull the victim to the side.
If the victim is farther out, a reach pole can be used. A
distressed swimmer will probably reach for the pole, but
an active drowning victim will not. For both types of
victims, make sure the pole comes into direct contact with
their hands and arms. Sweep the pole under their arm from
the side rather than poking at them straight on. In this,
and all rescues for an active victim, tell the victim clearly
what you are doing and what you wish them to do. Keep
your weight low with one leg behind the other and brace
yourself by putting your weight on the back leg.
If a conscious victim grabs an extended hand or pole, they
often will stop their own efforts to remain afloat. That sudden
extra weight can topple the unprepared rescuer into the
water. That is the reason for lying down or otherwise
bracing yourself. Don’t stand with your feet on the edge and
bend over to extend a hand or pole.
Unconscious victims will not be able to grasp a pole or
other device. You can still use a reaching rescue if you can
reach far enough with your own hand to grab them. You
can also use a special device, called a shepherd’s crook,
which may be available at hotel or other semiprivate pools.
The shepherd’s crook is a pole with a large loop on one
end. The loop is used to snag an unconscious victim below
the shoulders and draw them to shore. Do not use this
technique if you suspect that the person is unconscious
because he or she dove into shallow water and injured
their spine.
The simplest reaching rescues are performed without
entering the water. In other cases, your reach can only
be extended far enough by going partway toward the
victim. In deep water, you should firmly grab a rigid
object, such as the edge of a dock or a pool ladder. In
shallow water, you may be able to wade directly to a small
child who can’t touch bottom or to an unconscious person
who hit their head on the bottom. In a unit safe swim area,
you should know the range of depths for which a wad-
ing rescue is appropriate. In lifesaving situations, always
be extremely careful about wading in shallow water
toward someone your own size who is struggling to stay
up. The victim has probably stepped off a ledge into deep
water. It’s appropriate to extend a pole to such a person
if you have a firm footing on the bottom.


Chapter 9: Water Rescue 95
Throwing Rescues
If a victim is beyond reach of a hand or pole, a throwing
device may be used. A float with a line attached is best since
the float provides support and the line allows you to pull the
victim in. But either a float or a rope can be used alone.
Although they can be used for some active victims, throwing
assists are not appropriate for unconscious subjects. Also it
may be difficult to place a line such that an active drowning
victim can grasp it. Therefore, unit swim protection cannot
rely solely on throwing devices. Throwing rescues are not
needed much around pools, particularly small private ones,
because reach poles alone can provide adequate coverage.
A ring buoy with a line is handy at a lake with rescue
personnel stationed on a pier or floating platform. A throw
bag is a primary rescue device for river float trips.
An unweighted rope, or heaving line, should be coiled before
a toss. Tie a small bowline loop in one end and place the
loop on your wrist so you won’t accidentally toss the entire
line into the water. The loop should be loose enough that you
can easily slip your hand free if needed. To coil the line for
a right-handed throw, place your left hand on your left knee
and stretch the line to the full reach of your right hand. Then
return the line from your right hand to your left hand to form
the first coil. If you leave your left hand fixed to your knee
and reach as far as possible each time with your right hand,
all of the coils will be the same size and less likely to tangle
when thrown. Reverse the directions for a left-handed toss.
This technique is better than wrapping short coils on your
forearm or moving both hands apart and then together.
When approximately half of the line is coiled, gather the
loops with the index finger of the hand holding the coils,
and coil the rest of the line on your remaining fingers. This
will allow you to separate the rope into two coils, one from
which the line feeds and one that is thrown. You need the
weight of the second coil to make an accurate toss.
With one coil in each hand, step back with the leg on your
throwing side, swing back the arm with the free coil, and
throw the coil underhand to the victim. Release the coil
when your throwing arm is about level and still moving. If
you release too soon, the rope will land just in front of you.
If you wait too long, the line will go up rather than out. After
the release, the rest of the line will play off the open palm
of your other hand. The line should fall over the shoulder of
the victim in reach of his or her hands. If there is a cross-
wind or current, throw to the upwind or upstream side of
the victim. If you miss, recoil quickly and try again. Watch
the victim and not the line when recoiling.
When the victim grasps the line, drop the remaining
coil, if any, and reach out with one hand to grip the rope
with your thumb inward. Pull in the line with that hand
while you reach out with the other. Continue to alternate
pulling and reaching with each hand until the victim is
at the side or stands in shallow water. You need to pull
fast enough to keep the victim afloat, but do not jerk the
line from his or her hands. Provide the victim with instruc-
tions and encouragement.
A ring buoy is coiled and thrown in the same fashion as a
heaving line, except that there is no need to separate the
line into two coils. The buoy provides sufficient weight
for an accurate throw. Some ring buoys come with the
line in a plastic scoop wedged within the ring. Such an
arrangement keeps the line from tangling. More often, the
line for the ring buoy will be coiled. If so, give it a try as
is, but be prepared for the line to tangle. If it does, re-coil
the line with your hand on your knee like you would for a
heaving line.
Throw the buoy beyond the victim with the line falling over
their shoulder. Then pull the buoy to them. Tell the victim to
get a good grip on the buoy before you pull them in.


Chapter 9: Water Rescue96
If the line plays out clearly, but your aim is off, you do not
have to re-coil the line for a second try like you would for
a heaving line. Instead, you can drop the line at your feet
as you pull in the buoy and then try again.
You may find a ring buoy with a large wood bead, or
lemon, on the free end of the line rather than a wrist loop.
If that’s the case, you are meant to stand on the line with
the lemon behind your foot. The wrist loop is easier to
use, particularly if you’re moving with the ring buoy to
get to a better position or throwing it from a boat, but the
lemon also works. One reason for placing a lemon on the
line is to prevent the possibility that a nonswimmer using
the buoy could be jerked into deep water. For a similar
reason, be very cautious using a wrist loop for any line
thrown into a current or from a moving boat.
A makeshift buoy for a home
pool, boat, or troop swim kit
can be made from a gallon
plastic jug with about an inch
of water inside. Attach 50
feet or so (at least enough
to reach across your pool)
of light line to the handle
and tie a wrist bowline in the
other end. Solid-core woven line that floats is best, but
nylon will work. Ski rope can be used in a pinch. The jug
is thrown underhand like a regular buoy.
The throw bag, or rescue bag, is a common throwing
device often carried on canoes and kayaks. It can be
used at unit swims during float trips and makes a good
addition to a unit safe swim kit since it is an easy way
to store and transport a line. A floating line with a grab
loop is stuffed into a small nylon tube with a float at the
bottom. The float is not large enough to support a person
but does keep the bag on the surface. You hold the loop
in one hand and throw the bag underarm with the other.
The line plays out of the bag as it travels through the air.
An overhand toss can be used to clear weeds or a railing.
A rescue bag is probably the easiest way to throw a line.
It has the distinct advantage of always being ready for
use. You do not have to worry about the line becoming
tangled during storage or transport. If you miss your first
toss, then use the rope as a regular heaving line. It’s not
easy to quickly restuff a wet line for a second throw.
RESCUE BAG


Chapter 9: Water Rescue 97
Although heaving lines, ring buoys, and rescue bags are
extremely useful in some situations, it takes practice to
use them correctly. If a throw line is provided for use at
a unit swim, responders should practice until they can
repeatedly hit near a stationary target. If they cannot do
so, then it may be better to use the line to equip a pair of
swimmers for a line-and-tender rescue.
Rowing Rescues
The term “rowing rescue” refers to the emergency use
of any type of small craft, such as rowboats, canoes, or
kayaks. Boats are appropriate guard tools for swimming
sites in natural water bodies and should be used for that
purpose whenever available. The specific skills required
for the various craft are discussed in the Boating sec-
tion of this text. Ideally, the craft should be crewed by
two responders assigned as buddies. They should be
equipped with reaching devices, such as poles, paddles,
or oars, and flotation aids. As the boat approaches a con-
scious victim, the victim is thrown a flotation device or
extended a pole and instructed to hold on and calm down.
If the victim is unconscious, the rescuer in the stern of
a rowboat or the bow of a canoe grasps the victim and
holds them face up while the other person moves the
craft to shore. Lifting an unconscious person aboard a
boat is also an option but may be difficult. In a safe swim
area, the shore should be close.
If a submerged victim is visible from the surface, one
member of the team removes his or her life jacket, enters
the water, and brings the victim to the boat.


Chapter 9: Water Rescue98
In-Water Assists Procedure
If possible, avoid contact with active subjects. Contact is needed for unconscious subjects.
1. Recognize need, activate EAP.
2. Enter the water with pre-selected equipment.
3. Approach rapidly, keeping the subject in sight.


Chapter 9: Water Rescue 99
4. Provide support.
5. Move the subject to shore.
6. Assist or remove the subject from the water.
7. Provide care as needed.


Chapter 9: Water Rescue100
In-Water Assists
The next several headings deal with in-water assists,
which are divided into two classes depending on the need
to touch, or contact, the victim. In noncontact swimming
assists, the victim grasps the equipment you provide. In
contact rescues, you grasp the victim and the aid. Noncon-
tact rescues are the first choice for active victims. Contact
rescues are required for unconscious subjects and those
with a suspected spinal injury, but may also be needed for
victims with seizures or other debilitating conditions. Either
type of in-water assist should be performed only by skilled
swimmers with proper equipment and training. An in-water
assist involves an entry, an approach, a final assessment,
and helping the victim to shore.
Appropriate rescue aids include a rescue tube; a ring
buoy or floating cushion (Type IV life jackets); a life jacket
or vest (Type II and III life jackets) that is worn or carried;
other flotation aids such as an air mattress or foam rod;
or a line tended from shore.
Entries
This section assumes that the area is free of hazards, that
water depths are known, that rescue personnel do not
need to enter the water from heights greater than 3 feet,
and that rescue aids are available: all conditions
appropriate for a safe unit swim area.
Beach Entry
If the swimming area is
bordered by a shallow,
sloping beach, enter at a
run, lifting your legs high
and holding your rescue
aid out of the water. As the
water deepens and running
becomes difficult, lie on
the surface and kick off the
bottom. You can rest on a body board or air mattress,
hold a rescue tube across your chest, or push a ring buoy
or seat cushion ahead of you.
Ease-In Entry
Use an ease-in entry from
poolside or a dock into shallow
water. Drop to a sitting position
on the side and quickly slip into
the water with your rescue aid.
Begin swimming as soon as
the water is deep enough.
Compact Jump
You can jump feetfirst into deep or
shallow water from just above the
water. Bend at the knees with the feet
together. Keep your legs flexible and feet
flat to absorb shock if hitting the bottom.
Hold a soft rescue device across the
chest. Make sure lines and straps are
not tangled or caught on obstructions.
The compact jump is also used for
heights greater than 3 feet above the
surface—from some high lifeguard
stands, for example. Although such
heights may be appropriate for a lookout station, they are
not recommended for unit response personnel.
Noncontact Rescue
Contact Rescue


Chapter 9: Water Rescue 101
Stride Jump
The stride jump, or leaping
entry, allows you to keep the
victim in sight as you enter
deep water. It can be used
from low heights, less than
3 feet, into unobstructed water
at least 5 feet deep. Begin as if
you were trying to reach the victim in one giant step. You want
to move out, not up. Spring outward while leaning slightly
forward with your legs spread front and back in a scissors
position and your arms outstretched. Snap your legs together
and push down with your arms as each enters the water. If the
entry is correctly done, your head will remain above the water.
It might take several practice tries until you learn the proper
timing for the downward thrust of the arms. A rescue tube
or other soft flotation device can be placed under your arms
and held to your chest. The flotation makes up for the lack of
arm movement.
Approaches
The approach will generally be in a straight line from the
entry point to the victim. Frequent visual observation must
be maintained in case the victim submerges before being
reached. Always give verbal instructions and encourage-
ment when approaching a conscious victim.
The victim and rescuer will often be facing each other,
and many rescues can be initiated from a front approach.
However, some rescue techniques require rescuers to
position themselves behind the victim in a rear approach.
Adapt your swimming stroke to the condition of the victim,
the condition of the water, the type of aid being carried, and
the distance. If the distance is fairly short, as it will be in
most pools, then a head-up breaststroke is most versatile.
You can swim with a buoyant aid, such as a rescue tube,
beneath your arms. If that is too awkward, then the rescue
device may be pushed with one or two hands extended in
front. An alternative is to tow the aid using a sidestroke.
Large objects such as surfboards or air mattresses can
be ridden and propelled with the arms. The breaststroke is
also useful in rough water.
A crawl may be used if the rescue device can be carried
under the arms or is equipped with a shoulder strap and
towline. At times the details of the approach stroke will
be unimportant; for example, many backyard, apartment,
and hotel pools are so small that the entry and approach
are simultaneous.
As you finish the approach, but just before you assist the
victim, you should stop well out of reach, speak to the victim,
and reevaluate the situation from a ready position. The
victim could have become unconscious during your
approach, or they could tell you that they hit their head and
can no longer feel their legs. If the victim is able to respond,
either verbally or by moving in your direction, you gain useful
information for the assist. Be ready to back away from an
active victim if needed, but it is not necessary to actually
reverse direction if you stop a reasonable distance away.


Chapter 9: Water Rescue102
Noncontact Assists for
Conscious Subjects
There are several variations in how a flotation device can
be used to assist an active victim in deep water. One pos-
sibility is to use a contact tow in which the rescuer grasps
the victim from the rear and holds them against the rescue
aid while swimming to shore. That technique is perhaps
applicable to the widest range of victims, and will be discussed
later, but it is not the simplest procedure and requires more
stamina than others. The United States Lifesaving Associa-
tion reports that most of the thousands of rescues performed
yearly by lifeguards at beaches are accomplished from a front
approach by extending a flotation device to the victim. That, in
turn, leads to the following options:
Accompanied Rescue
In an accompanied rescue, the victim is allowed control of
a flotation device provided by the rescuer. There is minimal
risk of the victim grasping the rescuer, and the victim has the
maximum support of the aid. The victim must be conscious,
cooperative, and able to assist after becoming stable on
the device. The aid must be buoyant enough to support the
victim. This technique is suitable for a tired swimmer and
may be attempted for all active victims. You should maintain
a safe distance between yourself and the victim and be
ready at all times to duck beneath the water and move away.
From a ready position, quickly tell the victim that help is at
hand, that you will give them a float, and that they should grasp
it firmly. If the victim begins to move toward you, gently push
the float toward him or her while you back up. Don’t assume
that all victims will reach for the aid. The float may need to
be pushed under the victim’s arms or into contact with his or
her hands. Some devices, such as cushions or ring buoys,
can be pushed directly into the victim’s chest. If the float is
long and narrow, such as a rescue tube, air mattress, or foam
rod, it should be swung from the end under the victim’s arm or
pushed to them sideways. A victim is more stable with their
arms draped over the center of such a device than when try-
ing to hold it to their chest in line with their body.
After the victim has become stable on the float, reassure
them that they are safe and ask if they are able to kick their
way toward shore. If the victim can do this, patiently escort
them to the closest point of safety. That may not be the
same place where you entered the water.


Chapter 9: Water Rescue 103
Noncontact Tow
If the victim is unable to make progress toward the shore but
can support himself or herself with the aid, wait for them to
grow calm and decide how best to tow them to shore. Always
tell the victim in advance what you intend to do. Grasp the
flotation device with one hand, extend your towing arm, and
begin stroking away from the victim while holding onto the
aid. Use a sidestroke for the tow. Continue to reassure the
victim and encourage them to kick if appropriate. Watch for
signs of exhaustion or panic. If the victim panics and tries
to reach you, release the aid, quickly move away, and reas-
sess the situation. Resume the tow only when it is safe to
do so. At a unit swim, a second rescuer with another aid
should be ready to respond if the first guard encounters any
difficulty. This procedure is known as a noncontact tow
since the rescuer is in contact with the flotation aid, not with
the victim. Similar results may be achieved if the rescuer
never releases the flotation device but instead begins
towing after the victim grasps one end.
Shallow-Water Assist
A conscious victim will probably be able to remove himself
or herself from the water once they get sure footing on the
bottom or a firm hold on a ladder. If the victim is exhausted,
cold, or has trouble with their footing, you can help them
ashore using a shallow-water assist. While standing at their
side, help them to stand and to place one arm across your
shoulder. Grasp the wrist of that arm with your outside hand,
and wrap your free arm around their back. Then walk slowly
together to shore. If the victim is much larger than you are, a
second person can help from the other side.
Aftercare for a Conscious Victim
Even a victim who has been conscious throughout the rescue
may need treatment for shock. If a medical condition, such
as a stroke, led to the incident, summon EMS immediately or
arrange for evacuation from a remote site. If the victim shows
signs of hypothermia, move them quickly to warmth.
Contact Rescues for
Unconscious Victims
If the victim is unconscious, floating facedown either at or
beneath the surface, then the rescuer must necessarily
make physical contact with the victim. Different techniques
are available depending on whether the rescuer approaches
from the rear or the front. Each technique is easily adapted
for use with certain flotation aids but may be used without
an aid, to bring the victim to the surface, for instance, or
during a line-and-tender rescue. For ease of learning, each
technique will be described first assuming that the rescuer
is wearing a flotation aid, and then expanded to include
using a separate flotation device to support the victim.


Chapter 9: Water Rescue104
A front or rear approach can always be turned into the
other simply by swimming around the victim. However, that
might also necessitate reversing direction after the victim is
in tow to reach a point of safety. The different techniques
presented here provide the rescuer with options. Those
assigned to emergency response at a specific unit swim
site need not be equally skilled in all the techniques, so long
as they know at least one technique to handle any likely
situation. Just before a unit swim, assigned rescue personnel
may need a practice drill.
Wrist Tow (for Front Approach)
The wrist tow may be used if you approach a facedown
victim from the front. It will work if the victim is at the
surface, floating beneath the surface, or resting facedown
on the bottom.
After you confirm that the victim is unconscious, come
within an arm’s length. Reach across to the victim’s opposite
wrist as if you were shaking hands, and take hold under
their wrist with your palm up. Hold firmly and roll your wrist
by turning your thumb up and over as you begin your tow.
That twist in your wrist will turn the victim onto their back.
Maintain the same grip as you tow the victim to safety with
a sidestroke. A slight tension in your arm is needed to keep
the victim faceup. Both your towing arm and the victim’s arm
should remain straight.
The wrist tow can also be used to place a flotation aid under
the victim’s shoulders and then followed by a cross-chest
tow. Hold the aid with one hand while you reach across
it with the other to grasp the victim’s wrist. Lift up slightly
as you twist the victim onto their back, and shove the float
beneath him or her as they turn. You will then need to change
your grip so that you can keep them on the float. Place one
arm over the victim’s shoulder and reach across their chest
to grasp the aid with your hand. That should steady the vic-
tim on the float and leave your other arm free for swimming.
Armpit Tow (for Rear Approach)
A single armpit tow is begun from the rear for an uncon-
scious victim at or very near the surface. Reach out with
one hand and grasp the victim under their armpit with your
thumb up and on the outside. (Your right hand goes to the
right armpit, or your left hand to the left armpit.) Pull back
with your arm and immediately begin swimming to shift the
victim from a facedown to a face-up position. It may take a
few strong strokes using both your legs and free arm to pull
the victim onto their back. Once you have the victim fairly
level, continue to shore with your towing arm extended. It
is important to keep the victim’s face out of the water.
If the victim is large, you may find it easier to pull them
onto their back if you grasp both their armpits and lean
backward while using a whip kick. If safety is only a short
distance away, you can continue with a double armpit
tow. Such a tow requires a strong, well-developed kick.
Once the victim is level, you may find it quicker and less
tiring to shift back to the single armpit tow.


Chapter 9: Water Rescue 105
The double armpit tow can also be modified for use
with some buoyant aids, particularly if they are soft and
relatively long and narrow, such as rescue tubes, foam
rods, or air mattresses. Approach the victim from the rear
with the float across your chest and under your arms.
Scoop your elbows under the victim’s armpits, grasp their
shoulders, and then either roll over or lean back. Either
action should pull the victim face up on top of the flotation
device. A roll is probably easier for a large victim. Leaning
back prepares the rescuer to return along the approach
direction. The aid is held in place between the victim’s
back and your chest. Once under way, you may be able
to let go of the victim with one hand so you can swim
more effectively.
Submerged Victims
An unconscious victim can come to rest anywhere between
the surface and the bottom. If the victim is floating just below
the surface, you can reach down and use the wrist tow to
bring them up and forward. If the victim is deeper, you will
need to use a surface dive to get closer. A headfirst surface
dive may be used in deep, clear water. If you have a flotation
aid, leave it at the surface.
Grasp the submerged victim in any logical manner, either by
the wrist, under one arm, or under both arms. If the victim is
on the bottom, you can shove against it with your legs to help
you up. In a small pool, the victim can be taken directly to the
side since rescue breathing
is needed as soon as pos-
sible. In a larger area, the
victim may be placed on a
flotation device to speed
the swim back to shore.
Rescue of a submerged victim is easiest if the water
is clear enough for you to see both the victim and the
bottom, and the water is relatively shallow. Recovery is
more difficult, and in some cases impractical, if the water
is murky and/or deep. If you saw the victim submerge as
you approached, but you cannot see him or her from the
surface, then you should do a feetfirst surface dive with
the hope that you will make contact.
If you do not encounter the victim on the first dive, signal
for help (which should already be on the way). Continue
to surface dive in the immediate area but realize that you
are also marking the location. Other rescuers can expand
the search in a circle about your location. A search for
a missing swimmer in an unknown location is different
from the response for an observed submersion and will
be discussed further.


Chapter 9: Water Rescue106
Landing an Unconscious Victim
The unconscious victim needs to be moved as quickly as
possible to a location where breathing and pulse can be
monitored and CPR performed if necessary. It is some-
times possible to start rescue breathing in shallow water
or at the side of a boat. If that is not practical, or CPR is
needed, remove the subject from the water and position
on a rigid surface. Removing an unconscious victim from
the water often requires more than one rescuer.
Beach Drag
A drag is a relatively easy and safe way for one or more
rescuers to remove an unconscious victim where there
is a sloping bottom. During the tow, the victim will be on
their back. Once your feet touch bottom, grasp the victim
under their armpits and pull them onto the beach by slowly
walking backward. Support the head with your forearms
or against your chest and keep your back straight as you
bear their weight with your arms. Gently lower the victim
to the ground once they are clear of the water. If the vic-
tim is heavy, have someone help by taking hold under one
of the victim’s arms while you hold the other. Move slowly
enough not to stumble on a rough or slippery bottom.
Vertical Lift
This technique is used
for unconscious victims
at the vertical edge of a
pool or low pier or on a
steep lake or riverbank.
It needs from one to four
people depending on the
relative size of the peo-
ple involved, the condition of the bank, and the depth of
water at the edge. Ideally, two rescuers will be onshore
above the victim and two more in the water on each side
of the victim.
The initial rescuer tows the victim to the side and holds them
facing the edge while the others get into position. The rescu-
ers onshore crouch and each grasp one of the victim’s arms,
as near the armpit as is comfortable. If the water is shallow
enough for them to stand, the rescuers in the water prepare
to lift on each side of the victim’s hips. On a signal, the res-
cuers lift the subject until their hips or thighs are level with
the side. The victim is then lowered facedown to the ground
with care taken to protect the head.
Next, roll the person onto his or her back. However, first
make sure the hips are firmly supported. That may require
sliding the victim forward.
Backboard Lift
Backboards are sometimes required at hotel or apartment
pools without lifeguards on duty. If a backboard is avail-
able, it can be used to help extract an unconscious person
from the pool. Head restraints should be removed from the
board before use. Two people on the deck are required.
The victim is turned facing the side while supported by a
rescuer in the water. A rescuer on the deck crosses arms
to grab the victim’s opposite wrists and lifts enough to
keep the victim’s head out of the water. The second per-
son on the deck slips the backboard vertically between
the wall and the victim. The person holding the victim
then turns the victim’s back to the board by uncrossing
the arms. Each rescuer grasps one wrist of the victim
and the top of the board with their other hand. On signal,
both rescuers pull the backboard with the victim over the
deck, sliding it on the edge of the pool. The rescuers step
back and lower the board to the deck. (Rescuers need to
be wary of poor traction if the deck is wet and slippery.)


Chapter 9: Water Rescue 107
Aftercare for an
Unconscious Victim
As the rescue of an unconscious victim begins, EMS or
other advanced medical aid should be summoned. An
unconscious victim will probably need rescue breathing
and may need CPR.
If the victim is breathing but is still unconscious, place
them in a recovery position and keep them warm until
help arrives. Monitor vital signs.
If the victim regains consciousness, either on his or her own
or as a result of your efforts at CPR, keep him or her inactive
until EMS arrives. The victim might feel sufficiently recovered
and wish to escape further attention, including the possibility
of an ambulance trip to a hospital. But real danger remains.
Victims who have aspirated water (that is, inhaled a small
amount of water into their lungs) may collapse hours after
the rescue. Inhaled water can irritate the lungs and cause
them to fill with fluid from within the body. Foreign matter in
the lungs can also lead to pneumonia. All submerged victims
should undergo prompt medical evaluation. In remote loca-
tions, evacuation should be arranged.
Missing Submerged Victims
The rescue techniques discussed above assume prompt
emergency recognition and response. However, what hap-
pens if a buddy check reveals a missing person or a miss-
ing buddy pair? If that happens, several Safe Swim Defense
safeguards have failed. Despite preventive measures, a
crisis developed that neither buddies nor the safety team
(lookout and responders) were able to recognize. That
should seldom, if ever, happen. However, the count taken
during a buddy check provides a final alert mechanism. For
Safe Swim Defense to work properly, that final safeguard
must be unambiguous. If the unit leader first assumes that
the missing person or persons simply wandered off on land,
and searches there first, then that leader has not properly
implemented Safe Swim Defense standards requiring
an accurate, current count of everyone in the water. If
Safe Swim Defense guidelines are in place, then a
missing person during a buddy check means a person is
submerged in the water, and that is a major life-threatening
emergency with the clock ticking ominously.
If the water is clear enough to see the bottom, then a
search from the surface is relatively quick and easy,
either from the side or from swimmers in the water. The
first region to search is the ability area where the missing
person was assigned. The search should then widen
to cover the other ability areas and also just outside the
boundaries, and under docks or in other restricted zones.
If there is a current, first check the downstream perimeter.
If the bottom cannot be seen from the surface, then the
situation is much more difficult and may be further hampered
by waves or a current. In shallow water, use a line search
with swimmers linking arms and traversing the area while
shuffling their feet. Once anyone in the line gets to chest-
deep water, the line should be directed back into shallow
water. Crisscross the area until the subject is found or each
part of the area has been searched at least twice.

Chapter 9: Water Rescue108
In deep water, only reliable, competent swimmers should
be used in an underwater search for a submerged victim.
An underwater search in turbid water is difficult and not
without risk to the rescue team. At a Cub Scout event,
only two or three adults may be deployed, whereas many
members of a Venturing crew may be able to assist.
However, time is critical. A prompt search with a few
prepared individuals is better than a search delayed
trying to organize and instruct a large team.
The divers form a line, surface dive together to the bottom,
scour the bottom with their hands for a set number of strokes
(typically three), and then surface. Buddies are checked
every time the line surfaces. The line then reforms, backs up
a bit, and dives again.
The adult supervisor should not allow the search to
continue beyond the point that rescuers become
exhausted. In anticipation of such difficulty, a unit
swimming area in turbid water should be small enough
in area, and shallow enough in depth, that the number of
available search personnel can cover the bottom rapidly.
If the unit leader is not confident of performing a safe,
rapid, and effective underwater search in murky water,
participants may be required to wear life jackets to
minimize the possibility that anyone will submerge.
Contact Rescues for
Conscious Victims
Noncontact assists
are preferred for
active victims. They
are effective and they
reduce the risk that
the victim will grab
the rescuer. In some
situations, however, a
conscious victim will
be unable to grasp a
flotation aid. The victim may be incapacitated by a stroke
or a seizure. An actively drowning victim may fail to grasp
an object even after repeated attempts to place it under
the victim’s arms. In those cases, the rear approach and
double armpit tow discussed for unconscious victims
may be used, preferably with a flotation aid.
Defenses
Rescuers using the rescue
techniques discussed in this
section should be at little risk
from the victim. If the victim
reaches for the rescuer rather
than an aid, the rescuer should
back off. However, if the
victim grabs the rescuer, the
following techniques should resolve the situation.
An active distraught victim needs support to keep his or her
head clear of the water. The concern is to breathe, not to pur-
posely hold a rescuer beneath the water. Therefore, if a victim
reaches for or grabs a rescuer, the first defense is for the
rescuer to go underwater. The victim probably will let go on
their own since they are trying to stay up rather than sub-
merge. They certainly will not swim down after the rescuer.
At a unit swim, a rescuer in difficulty should quickly be
assisted by a second rescuer, ideally with a flotation aid.
Wrist Escape
If a victim grabs your wrist,
you have two options. If the
victim is small and safety is
near, you may decide to let
him or her hang on while you
quickly tow them to shore.
However, if you are uncom-
fortable with the situation,
you should break free. If the
victim is holding your wrist
with only one hand, break the
hold by quickly jerking your arm against their thumb. If the
victim grasps your wrist or forearm with both hands, make a
fist with your restrained hand, grab it with your free hand, and
jerk them both upward. If that does not break the hold, push
down with your arms to pull the victim lower in the water.
Rear Head-Hold Escape
If a victim grabs you around the neck or shoulders from
the rear, take a quick breath, tuck your chin to the side,
and submerge both yourself and the victim using the arm
motion of a feetfirst surface dive. This action is known as
suck, tuck, and duck. If the victim does not let go, grasp
their upper arms near the elbows and shove upward.
Swim clear of the victim before surfacing.


Chapter 9: Water Rescue 109
Front Head-Hold Escape
The same technique is used if the victim grabs you from the
front. Take a quick breath (suck), pull your chin down and to
the side so it doesn’t hang on their arm (tuck), and submerge
(duck). If the victim does not let go, push upward with your
hands beneath their arms. You may also push a smaller victim
up with your arms against their hips while you lean forward.
Stabilization of Spinal
Injury Victims
Diving into shallow or unclear
water is dangerous and foolish.
The diver faces an unnecessary
risk of spinal injury, permanent
paralysis, and death. In pools,
diving injuries occur most often
when a swimmer dives from the
side into shallow water, but can
also take place if the diver hits
another swimmer or a diving board. When the bottom
slopes gently into deep water, a swimmer attempting a
shallow dive may hit the bottom, particularly at a surf
beach where the water depth varies between swells. All
participants at a unit swim should be warned about the
dangers of diving, and only allowed to enter the water
headfirst if the height, water depth, and water clarity con-
form to Safe Swim Defense guidelines.
If a spinal injury is suspected at a unit swim site, EMS
or other advanced medical care must be summoned
immediately. Spinal injuries are extremely serious and
require special equipment. The unit leaders’ task is to provide
in-line stabilization until advanced help arrives to place the
victim on a backboard. Stabilization includes turning a victim
face up and holding them to lessen further movement. Even
though any movement of the victim may worsen a spinal
injury, a victim must not be left floating facedown; death
by drowning is a greater concern. If the victim was found
facedown, he or she may also require rescue breathing.
Suspect a neck or spinal injury anytime a person strikes
their head on anything but the water during a dive,
particularly if the person is immobile or unconscious upon
surfacing. If there is a suspicion of spinal injury, assume the
worst. Initiate in-line stabilization and check for breathing.
Other symptoms, which may be observed after the victim is
stabilized face up, include a lack of feeling or the inability
to move hands or feet. However, don’t release in-line
stabilization even if the victim has feeling or movement.
Wait for EMS to make an evaluation.
At the first indication of a spinal injury, take steps to stop
everyone in the water. An immediate buddy check may
not be appropriate in a crowded area because swimmers
converging on their buddies are likely to jostle the vic-
tim. After the rescuer has made contact, account for
everyone else and have them carefully exit the area.
Head and Chin Support
One technique to maintain in-line stabilization is to hold
the victim’s head while squeezing their chest between
your forearms. If the victim is face up, approach from the
side and lower your shoulders to the water. Speak to the
victim if he or she is conscious. Place one forearm in
the middle of the victim’s chest and the other along their
spine. Gently grasp the back of the victim’s head with
your lower hand and grip the jaw with your upper hand.
Clamp the victim in position by squeezing your forearms
together. A second rescuer should monitor vital signs and
perform rescue breathing if necessary.
If the victim is facedown, again approach from the side.
You may need to move the victim’s nearest arm to their
side. Do so by grasping their shoulder with one hand
and using the other to move the arm into position. Lower
yourself to shoulder depth. Next, place your arms and
hands as before to support the victim’s head. After you


Chapter 9: Water Rescue110
have clamped the
victim’s chest between
your arms, begin mov-
ing slowly forward. Roll
the victim toward you,
take a breath, and turn
the victim faceup as you
roll beneath them. Avoid
lifting or pulling down
on the victim during the
roll. The water must be
around 3 feet or greater
in depth to perform
the roll without lifting
the victim.
Head Splint
Another technique is
to squeeze the victim’s
head between his or
her arms. If the victim
is facedown, approach
them carefully from the
side. Stand near his of
her head facing slightly forward. Since the victim’s arms
may be dangling at their side, the first step is to move
them forward alongside their head. Reach across with
your near arm and grasp the victim’s outside arm (right-
to-right or left-to-left) between the elbow and the shoul-
der with your thumb toward their hand. Grasp their other
arm similarly with your free hand. Carefully swing their
arms forward until they are near his or her ears.
Once the arms are in position, squeeze them both at the
same time against the victim’s head to trap it in place.
Next, pull the victim slowly forward at the same time you
roll them face up. You turn the victim by pushing down on
his or her near arm and pulling their far arm across. As
you roll the victim, your own body should twist slightly to
face their feet. Lower yourself in the water as needed to
prevent lifting the victim. Ideally, you should be at shoul-
der depth, but that may be difficult in very shallow water.
After you roll the victim face up, continue to hold their head
in place with pressure on their arms. You can brace one
hand against your shoulder to make it easier. Check to see
if the victim is breathing; if he or she is not, have a second
rescuer start rescue breathing and check for a pulse.
If the victim is initially face up, you approach from behind
the victim’s head and pull their arms into position as you
face their feet. That will place you squatting with both your
arms beneath their head. You can also approach from the
side while facing their head. Reach one arm across the
victim’s chest to squeeze their arms against their head.
That approach allows you to kneel in very shallow water.
If the victim is in deep water, both the head splint and the head-
and-chin support techniques can be applied while the person
is simultaneously moved to shallow water. The rescuer needs
strong swimming skills, particularly a rotary kick.
Maintain in-line stabilization until EMS arrives with trained
personnel and a backboard. Unit leaders are not expected
to have the necessary equipment at a unit swim site to safely
remove such a victim from the water. However, if a victim of
spinal injury does not have a pulse, then CPR will be needed,
and cannot be performed effectively in the water. If EMS
has not arrived by the time that in-line stabilization is estab-
lished, a person without breathing and circulation should be
removed from the water with as little movement of the head,
neck, and back as practical given the need for prompt first
aid. Several people may be able to lift the person horizontally
from the water onto the side of a pool.


Chapter 9: Water Rescue 111
A spinal injury managed with care may still have dire
consequences. Prevention is better than any treatment.
Be sure to cover the dangers of diving during the tailgate
review before a swim, and diligently enforce the policies
on headfirst entry.
Line and Tender
The line-and-tender procedure uses a buddy team to effect
a rescue. A rope or line tended by one buddy onshore
is carried to a victim in the water by the other buddy.
The onshore buddy then pulls both the victim and the line
carrier to safety.
The procedure can involve elements of other rescue
techniques. It is similar to a throwing rescue of an active
victim using a line, but accuracy is achieved by the line
carrier swimming past the victim and pulling the line into
contact. If a flotation device is available, the line carrier
may shove it to the victim. If the victim is unconscious,
the line carrier can use a wrist tow or armpit tow to grasp
the victim, above or below the surface. In each situation,
both the victim and the rescuer are pulled back to shore
with the line.
The procedure is simple, requires little equipment or
training, and provides extra safety for the rescuer.
The only critical skills are that one person be a good
swimmer and that the other have sufficient strength to
pull two people through the water.
The rescue line should be around 3
⁄8-inch in diameter and
long enough to cover the swimming area. Floating line is
preferred, but nylon may be used. The line in a throw bag
is ideal, and the bag provides an easy way to store and
transport the line. To prepare the line, a bowline loop is
tied in one end of the rescue line and placed over one
shoulder and under the opposite arm of the line carrier.
The loop should be snug enough to ensure that it will not
come off while the line carrier is swimming or being pulled
in. The team should be positioned within easy reach of all
deep water used for swimming (approximately 50 feet).
When a person needs help, the line carrier makes an
appropriate entry and swims quickly toward the victim.
The line carrier swims past an active victim and then
turns to bring the line to the victim’s side. After the victim
grasps the line, the line tender pulls in both the victim and
the line carrier.
If the victim cannot grasp the line (is unconscious or
incapacitated, for example), the rescuer grasps the vic-
tim. Although a wrist tow or armpit tow is appropriate, the
rescuer need not be skilled in the use of those techniques.
Any secure hold will work since the rescuer is not required
to tow as well as to hold onto the victim.
The rescuer tending the line is first responsible for feeding out
the line to prevent tangling as the line carrier delivers the line
to the victim. The line should be ready in a neat, loose coil or
in a throw bag. The line tender then pulls in their partner and
the victim hand-over-hand, grasping the rope with thumbs
toward himself or herself to kink the rope to prevent it from
slipping. The line tender must be well braced on shore or dock
and must have sufficient strength and weight to pull in their
partner and the victim. A strong, rapid pull will keep the line
carrier and victim at the surface.
The line-and-tender procedure is similar in
concept to the reel rescues responsible for
saving thousands of lives on the beaches of

Chapter 9: Water Rescue112
“Every Scout a swimmer, every swimmer a lifesaver”
completes the early slogan. The Boy Scouts of America still recognizes
the validity of that goal. Basic water-rescue techniques are included
in rank advancement, and the Emergency Preparedness or Lifesaving
merit badge is required for Eagle Scout rank. Records from the National
Court of Honor show that Scouts of all ages do encounter emergency
situations where they are the person best prepared to respond. In those
situations, they will respond with or without training. A goal of BSA
programs is to equip them to respond safely and effectively. The proper
use of youth members in the protection of unit swimming activities
supports that goal.
During the early days of Scouting, it was noted that some Scouts lost
their lives in the attempt to aid others, either from head injuries sustained
when diving into unknown water or the inability to deal in the water with
an active victim. Procedures still followed today, such as the leaping
entry; emphasis on reach, throw, row, go as the proper sequence; and
the use of equipment during swimming assists, were all introduced or
adopted by the BSA years ago.
Note that water rescue training needs to be age appropriate. For Cub Scouts, a simple admonition to reach,
throw, go for help is more fitting than a detailed explanation of reach, throw, row, go, but the first is still
consistent with and leads to the second as the youth matures.
The procedure should be practiced until both team
members are capable and confident in their roles. All
unit members should understand the procedure and
know to “clear the way” when the team is responding.
This need for practice and understanding is one
important reason the line-and-tender rescue is a First
Class rank requirement.
The line-and-tender procedure may be augmented with
flotation aids. The line carrier may wear a life jacket and/
or carry a flotation aid.
Note that the line-and-tender procedure is not
recommended when there are obstructions, such as
submerged trees, in the water. However, such conditions
would violate the criteria for a safe area.
The line-and-tender procedure is appropriate wherever
there is an expanse of deep water beyond easy reach from
poolside, shore, or dock, particularly if team members lack
extensive rescue training. More than one line-and-tender
team may be stationed as needed along the shore, on a pier,
or on a detached floating dock. However, other response
teams may depend on reach poles or a boat rather than a
line. Reaching and wading rescues will provide adequate
coverage at many small, residential in-ground or above-
ground pools. Therefore a line-and-tender team need not be
deployed in all situations.


Safety Team Preparation
Every Scout a swimmer, every swimmer a lifesaver is still a goal. However, simply having trained rescuers at
hand does not constitute adequate preparation to prevent and safely respond to drowning emergencies at a unit swim.
The unit leader, the qualified supervisor, the lookout, and emergency response personnel are all important components
of a safety team. Each needs to understand their function and how it relates to the others, even though a single individ-
ual may serve in more than one role. Safe Swim Defense defines those functions, but this section expands on the duties
and interactions of team members, particularly during a crisis. Team members need to be provided with the necessary
equipment, coached in an emergency action plan, and deployed to cover the area effectively.
Chapter
10


Chapter 10: Safety Team Preparation114
• The unit leader makes sure there is a trained adult
present to serve as the qualified supervisor for the
swim. If the unit leader does not fill that position, then
the leader provides unit resources and support to
that person. If the unit leader serves as the qualified
supervisor, then he or she should recruit at least one
other adult as an assistant to help with discipline,
particularly during an emergency, and to satisfy
Youth Protection policies.
• The qualified supervisor reviews health infor-
mation and ability group classifications, guides the
setup of the areas, makes lookout and emergency
response assignments, deploys those people to pro-
vide effective surveillance, ensures that appropriate
rescue aids and communication devices are avail-
able, develops and explains the emergency action
plan for the event, coordinates execution of the plan
during a crisis, and assigns someone to check par-
ticipants in and out of the area if needed.
• The lookout maintains a constant watch to ensure
that all elements of Safe Swim Defense are working.
The lookout normally calls buddy checks and clears
the pool if needed during emergencies. Although not
required to assist in water rescues, the lookout may
do so if qualified, but only after the safety of everyone
else in the group is established. If the qualified super-
visor serves as the lookout, he or she must assume
no other duties, such as providing stroke instruction
or grilling hamburgers.
• Response personnel are designated by the
qualified supervisor to closely monitor the activity
and respond during emergencies. The emergency
action plan should clarify the roles of each individual
responder—for example, who reacts to an emer-
gency in one part of the swimming area, and what
the others do to maintain the safety of everyone else
during such a situation. The responder’s monitoring
role is just as important as emergency response.
Each person needs to continuously scan his or her
assigned area. The ratio of responders to swim-
mers is 1-to-10; however, different unit members may
rotate in the role during the course of the activity. The
qualified supervisor may also serve as a responder.
Surveillance
According to Safe Swim Defense: Every swimming
activity must be closely and continuously moni-
tored by a trained rescue team on the alert for and
ready to respond during emergencies. The underlining
is added to emphasize that surveillance is a primary function
of response personnel. Recognition of that function is a key
component in swimmer protection. Unit leadership is
responsible for providing sufficient instructions to the safety
team to minimize the risk of an unobserved submersion.
Emergency response personnel and lookouts are observ-
ers who watch for the characteristics of a swimmer at
risk. They should be positioned such that all swimmers are
constantly scrutinized, and they must not engage in any
activities that divert their attention from that surveillance.
In rare situations, such as a snorkeling excursion away
from an anchored boat, responders may be deployed in
the water with swimmers. Normally, watchers should
be elevated above the water. For the small, uncrowded
areas typical of a unit swim, a standing position is
normally adequate. A poolside position also helps with
discipline and provides for rapid response. Visibility at
larger areas is improved if elevated stands are available.
Observers should be able to see all of their assigned area
with little head movement and should not be facing into
the sun or glare. Sunglasses with polarized lenses and UV
protection aid visibility and protect the eyes.
For small areas, observers may be assigned to watch the
entire area (total coverage). They should do so from differ-
ent vantage points and be in sight of at least one other person
on surveillance duty. Each responder should be assigned a
buddy who provides backup for the rescue. (For example, the
backup may be a line tender for a line rescue.) In turbid water
conditions, the responder’s buddy should act as a spotter in
case the victim submerges before being reached.
For larger areas, responders should be assigned to cover
specific areas, such as the deep end past a ladder, or
the beginner area from line to line (zone coverage).
There should be enough safety personnel to overlap sur-
veillance of all areas by at least 100 percent. Typically,
a lookout will provide total coverage of the entire area
while response teams provide zone coverage of limited
extent. That type of overlapping surveillance is known as
combined coverage.


Chapter 10: Safety Team Preparation 115
When zones are used, they should be clearly defined by
distinct features, such as lines, ladders, or docks. Vague
instructions, such as “halfway across” or an imaginary
circle on a diagram, can lead to confusion where one
area meets another.
Dual coverage of the area by others is important because
it allows a safety team member to momentarily interrupt
scanning to deal with minor problems without leaving the
area unattended. For example, a responder may need to
direct a swimmer with a nosebleed, and the swimmer’s
buddy, to the adult supervisor. Or, the responder may need
to call a swimmer to the side to caution against sunburn.
If a responder must enter the water for a rescue, that
responder’s buddy provides backup assistance if needed.
Other response teams should automatically increase
their surveillance zones to help the lookout cover the area
normally covered by the team performing the rescue.
Even though an observer’s assigned area should be
small enough to view in its entirety, the observer should
still perform a systematic scan so that swimmers in dif-
ferent parts of the area come under close observation.
Visual sweeps may be from side-to-side, in-and-out, or
varied, and should include both the surface and the bot-
tom. The bottom immediately below the station should not
be neglected. Sweeps may be interrupted to more closely
examine motion caught by peripheral vision (out of the
corner of the eye), but should quickly be resumed unless
an emergency is noticed.
It is more important to focus on the swimmers than on a
particular scanning pattern. Effective scanning requires
deliberate attention to swimmer behavior. For small
groups at unit swims, head counting is very effective.
Update the count as swimmers enter or leave the zone.
Between counts, scan the entire zone and track individu-
als (someone swimming underwater, for example); note
group interactions, such as those playing a game; and
look for signs that someone is in trouble or is breaking
the rules. If a swimmer appears to be alone, the observer
should immediately scan for the buddy. If it is appar-
ent that the buddies are not watching each other, the
observer should either catch their attention or call for a
buddy check to remind buddies to stay together.

Chapter 10: Safety Team Preparation116
A safety team member assigned surveillance duty is
expected to intervene promptly to prevent accidents as
well as to recognize and respond to emergencies. Those
are the only tasks that should be undertaken. Observers
should focus on the task at hand and not engage in casual
conversation. If it is necessary to speak with a swimmer,
the observer should do so quickly and continue to scan
the area if possible. Effective scanning involves hearing as
well as vision. Observers should not listen to music using
earphones while on duty.
Unit members acting as observers at a unit swim should
be changed frequently to allow as many as are qualified
to serve, and to allow everyone the opportunity to have
fun. The best time to change safety personnel is during
a buddy check. A typical swimming activity should last
only an hour or so. Adult observers with critical skills may
serve for the entire time.
The lookout should be in a position to observe the entire
swimming area as well as the deck or shore. His or her
task is to make sure everything is as it should be, for
example: responders are in position; distant clouds are
not threatening; no one is entering or leaving without
checking in or out. The lookout typically signals buddy
checks and confirms the count. In an emergency, the
lookout decides whether to sound an emergency sig-
nal and provides backup surveillance of the zone where
the rescue is taking place. When one team responds,
the lookout and other responders are responsible for
emergency communication and the supervision of the
rest of the swimmers.
The lookout serves the important functions listed below
and is not a redundant observer who lacks the qualifica-
tions to be a rescuer. A comparable position at a public
facility would be that of lifeguard captain. At a minimum,
a good understanding of Safe Swim Defense is required.
Often the qualified supervisor is the person best suited to
serve as the lookout at a unit swim. A youth member may
be designated as the lookout, but if he or she lacks the
experience required to fulfill all the duties of the position,
then the qualified supervisor should assume those roles
and in effect serve as a backup lookout and/or responder.
A LOOKOUT SURVEYS THE ENTIRE AREA AND:
✔ Looks for deviations from
Safe Swim Defense
✔ Monitors the environment
✔ Provides backup surveillance
during a rescue
ADDITIONAL DUTIES MAY INCLUDE:
➡ Conducting buddy checks
➡ Clearing the area during an emergency


Chapter 10: Safety Team Preparation 117
Communication
A rescue at a unit swim site may involve nothing more than a
simple reaching assist to a person with a momentary cramp.
However, any rescue, from simple to complex, should
be considered a team effort. Such coordination requires
communication. It is not necessary to equip all supervisory
personnel with whistles and an elaborate code, but it is
necessary to establish a few fundamental signals.
A single short blast of a whistle is often used at public
facilities as a warning given to a particular individual
to stop some action. If the whistle is overused for that
purpose, swimmers can become accustomed to the sound
and tend to ignore it. Although such a signal is sometimes
useful, it should be used sparingly, if at all, at a unit swim.
Direct verbal communication is recommended to correct
inappropriate activity by a specific individual. A buddy
check can be called to quell group infractions.
The signal for a buddy check should be simple and easily rec-
ognized, such as a single long blast of a whistle or an air horn.
The signal for a buddy check does not normally indicate an
emergency but can be used to clear the swimming area rap-
idly, particularly if unit members are required to sit on the side
of a small pool as opposed to standing stationary in a lake. A
buddy check is an appropriate part of an emergency action
plan if a swimmer indicates that they can’t find their buddy.
A buddy check can also be called to close down the activity
for weather, or simply when the allotted time has passed. A
separate “checkout” signal is not needed, and may actually
slow down the final buddy check. The same signal used to
call the buddy check can be sounded to resume swimming,
or replaced with a simple verbal directive to “resume
swimming.” Since all swimmers should remain silent during
the buddy check, voice communication is appropriate.
A specified emergency signal is needed to gain the attention
of the entire group without the corresponding scrabble for
buddies. The call should alert everyone to stop what they
are doing, freeze in place, and listen for instructions. The
signal can be used to clear the way for a line-and-tender
rescue or to prevent swimmers from colliding with some-
one in distress. It is also useful to minimize the possibility
that another crisis will arise while the first situation is being
resolved. Repeated short blasts of a whistle, or any other
simple sequence distinct from the buddy check call, may
be used. Both the “emergency” and “buddy check” signals
should be sounded and explained to the group at the final
procedural review before swimming begins.
During a crisis, response personnel react immediately
to perform the necessary assist. The lookout decides
whether it is appropriate to sound the call for a buddy
check or an emergency. Normally, the area and numbers
involved in a unit swim are small enough that respond-
ers, lookout, and unit leaders can communicate verbally
without the need for special signals among themselves. That
verbal communication can include a “call 9-1-1” directive to
the person previously assigned to make the call.
Before the activity, means
for contacting emergency
medical services must be
established. At urban loca-
tions, a phone call placed
to 9-1-1 on either a landline
or a cell phone is common,
and 9-1-1 may summon a
prompt response at some
rural settings. If a mobile
phone is used, make sure
there is cell coverage, the phone is charged, and the person
placing the call knows how to direct rescuers to the site. In
remote areas, it may be necessary to dial some other number
(e.g., a ranger station) or to first travel some distance to where
a phone is available. Communication with emergency services
is an important part of the emergency action plan.
SUGGESTED SIGNALS:
BUDDY CHECK: One long whistle blast means
everyone moves to their buddy and remains silent.
EMERGENCY: Repeated short whistle blasts
mean everyone freezes silently in place and
waits for instruction.
9-1-1
Know local emergency numbers
and arrange access to them.


Chapter 10: Safety Team Preparation118
Emergency Action Plans
Devising an emergency action plan may be simple or
complex, but it should be a deliberate undertaking for all
swimming activities. Swimming might be a side activity
during an excursion such as a backpacking trek or a float
trip. In that case, some components, such as arrange-
ments for medical services and evacuation, will be part
of the emergency action plan for the main activity. At a
minimum, the following items should be considered. Note
that all of these items should already be addressed by
a facility emergency action plan if the unit is swimming
where trained lifeguards are employed.
• Incident director. Safety team members should
respond automatically to emergency situations
without first seeking approval. However, there needs
to be a single individual designated to step in and
take charge if unexpected situations arise. That
person is the qualified supervisor defined by Safe
Swim Defense. If a unit leader aged 21 or older is
assisted by someone of lesser age trained in water
safety, then that person assumes this role. There
should also be a second person designated to
take charge if the emergency involves the primary
individual. Recall that adult cardiac arrest is the
most likely life-threatening emergency to arise
during unit outings.
• Safety team members (who and how many).
For a small crew of two adults and six youth, the two
adults, if properly trained, may serve as the lookout
and responders. For larger groups, there must be a
lookout and sufficient responders to maintain a ratio
of one responder for every 10 swimmers or fraction
thereof. For example, a group of 35 swimmers requires
one lookout and four responders.
• Safety team deployment. The lookout must be
able to observe the entire activity. If the group is too
large for that to be practical, then the group should
be subdivided into separate swimming areas, each
with its own complete safety team. Responders are
best deployed as buddy pairs watching the same
areas. If a line-and-tender procedure is used, then
the buddy pair will be stationed at the same location.
If other assists are appropriate, the pair may be
separated—for example, standing with a reach pole
or flotation device in waist-deep water at two
corners of a beginner area. The qualified supervisor
is responsible for positioning responders to provide
adequate coverage of all areas with due consider-
ation of the training and maturity of the individual
responders. The supervisor is also responsible for
providing each responder with rescue devices suit-
able to the responder’s level of training.
• Safety team duties. As a whole, the safety team
has five primary duties: careful tracking of the
number of people in the activity, continuous surveil-
lance of assigned areas, intervening to stop rule
infractions, intervening to provide emergency
assistance, and providing backup surveillance and
supervision of swimmers not involved in a rescue
situation. Backup surveillance is automatically
provided by designating a lookout separate from the
responders. The supervisor is responsible for
handling disciplinary problems.
• Likely emergencies. The supervisor should pre-
pare the safety team to respond appropriately to active
victims, unconscious victims (at or below the surface),
and potential spinal injuries. The supervisor may elect
to have specific safety team members respond to
special situations—a spinal injury, for example—but
in general each responder should be coached in how
to provide assistance in likely scenarios.
• Signals. The emergency action plan should include
audible signals for buddy checks and emergencies
and assign a specific individual, such as the lookout,
to decide when such signals are needed.
• EMS. Emergency medical services should be
summoned promptly for any incident that involves a
serious medical condition or victim submersion. The
emergency action plan must specify how that is done.
Parents should also be notified as soon as possible.
• Weather. All swimming activities should be curtailed
whenever thunder and lightning threaten.
• Tailgate review. Finally, the supervisor should
determine what aspects of the emergency action
plan to review with participants just before the event.


Chapter 10: Safety Team Preparation 119
Safe Swim Defense Kits
Various items are needed to set up and aid the safety team
in protecting a unit swim. Depending on the location, some
necessary equipment will already be on-site. For example,
many hotel pools have a ring buoy, shepherd’s crook, and
house phone within the area. In other situations, the unit
will need to carry support material with them. Some units
maintain a simple “swim kit” in a bag that travels with the
unit. Other units assemble a kit just before an outing with
the items they know will be needed. Items may include:
• Medical histories. The qualified supervisor should
review medical histories before the outing to deter-
mine any special precautions that may be necessary.
Copies of the forms should also be carried on any
remote trip and shared as appropriate with emergency
medical personnel. Information on allergies and
preexisting conditions may influence treatment
options. Also, the forms allow parents to authorize
emergency treatment if they cannot be reached.
• Cell phone. Portable phones are useful for
emergency communications and notifying parents of
changes in plans. Be sure to check coverage and
battery charge.
• Whistle. Handy for signaling buddy checks
or emergencies.
• Boundary lines. Light cord connected to floats can
be used to define nonswimmer and beginner areas.
Slightly thicker floating line is even better.
• Balloons. Balloons inflated on-site are easy to
transport and make highly visible floats to define
swim areas.
• Anchors. Rocks are often difficult to tie to; for
anchors, nylon or plastic sacks carried in the kit may
be stuffed with rocks or sand. Large fishing sinkers
may also be used.
• Rescue line. Polypropylene line in 100-foot lengths
can be used for throwing or line-and-tender rescues.
Solid braided line is better than loosely woven line
without a core. A throw bag is an easy way to
transport and use the line.
• Flotation devices. Different types of life jackets are
useful rescue aids. Foam “noodles,” inflatable air mat-
tresses, or rolled-up sleeping pads may also be used.
• Buddy tags and portable boards. A simple list of
names on a piece of paper is adequate for tracking
those in the water and their ability classification.
Some units save their buddy tags from summer camp
and use them with small, portable buddy boards.
Other options include tongue depressors stuck in the
sand, or wooden clothespins strung on a line. For
those, waterproof markers are used to print names
and color the ends by ability groups.
Policy on Use of the Annual Health
and Medical Record
In order to provide better care for its members and to assist
them in better understanding their own physical capabilities,
the Boy Scouts of America recommends that everyone who
participates in a Scouting event have an annual medical
evaluation by a certified and licensed health-care provider—a
physician (MD or DO), nurse practitioner, or physician assistant.
Providing your medical information on this four-part form will
help ensure you meet the minimum standards for participation
in various activities. Note that unit leaders must always protect
the privacy of unit participants by protecting their medical
information.
Parts A and B are to be completed at least annually by
participants in all Scouting events. This health history, parental/
guardian informed consent and release agreement, and
talent release statement is to be completed by the participant
and parents/guardians. Attach a copy of both sides of your
insurance card.
Part C is the pre-participation physical exam that is required
for participants in any event that exceeds 72 consecutive
hours, for all high-adventure base participants, or when the
nature of the activity is strenuous and demanding. Service
projects or work weekends may fit this description. Part C is
to be completed and signed by a certified and licensed heath-
care provider—physician (MD or DO), nurse practitioner, or
physician assistant. It is important to note that the height/
weight limits must be strictly adhered to when the event will
take the unit more than 30 minutes away from an emergency
vehicle, accessible roadway, or when the program requires
it, such as backpacking trips, high-adventure activities, and
conservation projects in remote areas. See the FAQs for when
this does not apply.
Part D is required to be reviewed by all participants of a high-
adventure program at one of the national high-adventure bases,
as well as unit-based, high-adventure backcountry activities,
and shared with the examining health-care provider before
completing Part C.
• Philmont Scout Ranch. Participants and guests for Philmont
activities that are conducted with limited access to the
backcountry, including most Philmont Training Center
conferences and family programs, will not require completion
of Part C. However, participants should review Part D to
understand potential risks inherent at 6,700 feet in elevation
in a dry Southwest environment. Please review specific
registration information for the activity or event.
• Northern Tier National High Adventure Base.
• Florida National High Adventure Sea Base. The PADI medical
form is also required if scuba diving at this base.
• Summit Bechtel Reserve.

Tailgate Review
Area setup and emergency plans set the stage for a safe
swim. A review of rules and procedures just before the
swim clears the stage for the activity. A tailgate review
should be short and simple, but include the following:
• Entering and leaving the area
• Ability areas
• Any hazards to avoid
• Buddy assignments
• Buddy check purpose, signal, and response
• Emergency signal and response
At a public facility with professional lifeguards, review
the following:
• Buddy assignments

The Underwater World
Water covers most of the earth’s surface. An extraordinary world of fantastic plants and animals awaits those who
venture beneath the surface, whether the trip is at a nearby lake, along a tropical reef, or beneath the ice in the Arctic.
The undersea world is too diverse to discuss in detail here, and seeing it in person is better than reading about it. The
BSA has two programs, Snorkeling BSA and Scuba BSA, that provide introductory skills for Scout-aged youth and
their leaders to contemplate an undersea journey. The Scuba Diving merit badge, and the Open Water Diver Certifica-
tion it includes, prepares Scouts to experience recreational submarine excursions in accordance with the BSA scuba
policy. The BSA Florida National High Adventure Sea Base provides the training and environment to make dreams of
underwater adventures a reality for older youth.
Compared with surface land, much of the submarine world remains a wilderness. But those areas most accessible
by people have suffered environmental damage similar to the open-air backcountry. Scouts know that caring for the
environment is a key aspect of enjoying the outdoors, whether above or below the sea. Leave No Trace concepts
apply to both worlds. Coral might look like a rock but is actually composed of living organisms. The general rule when
snorkeling and diving is “Look but don’t touch.” Not only does that rule protect the environment, it also protects
the diver. Some sea creatures have defenses best not provoked. The skills discussed below are to be learned in clear,
confined water. Before venturing into open water, learn more about the undersea ecosystem, both to protect it and to
protect yourself.

Mask Selection and Fit
The mask should have a
single or double tempered-
glass faceplate held to the
skirt with a rigid band. The
skirt, often of clear silicone,
should have a double seal
where it fits against the face.
There should be a pocket so
that the nose can be gripped
with one hand for equalizing pressure in the ears. The
strap should be easily adjustable and either split or wide
where it fits across the back of the head.
To fit a mask, place it against your face without using the
strap, then inhale gently through your nose. A mask properly
sized and shaped for your face will remain in place. If the
mask doesn’t seal easily, try another style. Don’t force the
mask to remain in place by pushing down on the skirt and
inhaling strongly. If the mask leaks underwater, or requires
excessive strap pressure, the fit is poor.
To fit the strap, inhale to hold the mask in place, then use
both hands to place the strap over the back of your head.
If the strap is too tight, stop and loosen each side a notch
or two. If the strap is too loose, tighten each side. Strap
adjustments vary in style. Some have a hinged clip; on
others, ridges are moved past a movable pin and held in
place by friction and a slide. Figure out how to lock and
unlock the device rather than forcing it. The strap should
be only tight enough to hold the mask comfortably to your
face. If the mask leaks, try a different style rather than
pulling the strap too tight.
You can also don the mask back to front. Grasp the mask
on each side with your thumbs hooked under the strap.
Lift the mask over your head to position the strap on the
back of your head, then pull the mask gently into place.
The mask strap rides above the ears.
Warm air from your nose contains water vapor that will
condense on the cool faceplate and block your vision. A
few drops of a commercial antimist solution spread on the
faceplate will prevent fogging. In a pinch, a bit of saliva will
work, but not as well. New masks may have a residue on
the faceplate that will contribute to fogging. Carefully wash
a new mask to remove any such coatings.

The Snorkel
A snorkel is simply a short breathing tube from your mouth
to the back of your head that allows you to breathe while
looking down with your face in the water. The simplest
designs are shaped like a J with a mouthpiece on the bent
end. Other designs have contoured bends to better fit
around the head. Still others have a flexible section near
the mouthpiece. Although flexible sections may be corru-
gated on the outside, they should be smooth on the inside
so that water is not caught in the ridges. Some snorkels
have one-way purge values near the mouthpiece. Oth-
ers have “dry top” vents designed to keep out surface
splashes. Regardless of design, the tube should have a
diameter of about an inch (about the size of your thumb)
and not be over 14 inches or so in length. A snorkel only
works over short lengths. Never try to breathe through
a hose to greater depths. The physics of the situation
makes air exchange with the surface impossible, and the
chemistry of rebreathing your own air causes problems.
A few snorkel designs have flapper values at the top to
keep water out during submersion. Conventional purging
techniques should be learned before using such systems.
Attach the snorkel to the mask strap using a “keeper,”
which comes in various designs. Tucking the snorkel
under the strap is not reliable and distorts the fit of the
mask. The snorkel may be attached to either side. Scuba
divers attach the snorkel on the left to avoid the regulator
hose that comes over the right shoulder.
Fins
Fins are flexible, wedge-shaped flippers worn on the
feet to improve the power of your kick. Blades come in
a variety of designs, some long and narrow, some split,
some with louvers, all claiming various improvements in
efficiency. In general, the larger and more rigid the blade,
the more power in the kick, but that also means tiring
more quickly. The most important considerations are a
comfortable fit and ease of use.
There are two basic types of fins: closed-heel and open-
heel. Closed-heel fins fit over the entire foot and are often
used for snorkeling in warm water. If one size is too tight,
and the next larger size is too loose, then a pair of socks
worn with the larger size may be useful. Some full-foot
fins float, which can be handy if a fin is accidentally
dropped in deep water.
Open-heel fins are designed to be worn with dive boots
and are held in place by an adjustable strap. They are a
good choice if a wet suit is needed in cool temperatures,
but are also useful in warm water where booties provide
foot protection on rocky beaches.
Fins should be put on wet, and ideally only when ready
to use. Occasionally, walking in fins may be necessary—
when wading through surf into deep water, for example.
If so, walk backward, slowly and carefully.
Chapter 11: The Underwater World 123


Vest
An inflatable vest is a useful tool
that adds to the enjoyment and the
safety of open-water snorkeling.
A few puffs of air in the oral infla-
tion tube provide buoyancy while
swimming out to a site or view-
ing it from the surface. The air is
released through the same tube
before a surface dive. Frequent
use provides comfort and prevents
exhaustion. A vest is not simply
a backup device reserved for
emergency use only, although it
does provide an extra safeguard
during a crisis.
Dive Flag
A dive flag should be used at open-water sites.
Swimmers are hard to see in the water. A dive flag
alerts boat operators to avoid the area. It may be
displayed from a dive boat or attached to a float and
towed with the snorkeling party. Local regulations
require boats to stay a minimum distance from the
flag (typically 100 feet) and may also mandate the
size of the flag and how close snorkelers must stay
to it (typically 50 feet).
Accessories
Useful accessories include a whistle attached to the
vest as a signaling device, gloves to protect the hands,
and protective clothing, either light everyday wear or
special dive “skins,” to limit sun exposure on the back
and legs. A mesh gear bag is handy for transporting
gear to and from the site and allows the gear to dry after
cleaning. In cooler waters, a wet suit provides comfort.
However, a wet suit also provides buoyancy that may
make surface dives more difficult. Experienced skin
divers may wear weight belts with wet suits to achieve
neutral buoyancy. Weights are not recommended for
anyone who has not been trained in their use by a
qualified instructor.
Snorkeling Skills
The following sequence of exercises covers skills
required for Snorkeling BSA. It is not a complete teaching
outline. Counselors for Snorkeling BSA need to review
the requirements and decide how to best cover the
skills and the cognitive material. Some items such as
dive signals, the effect of water on sight and sound, and
the need to equalize pressure are listed as distinct require-
ments but may be introduced and discussed as needed. Also
note that some of the requirements cover items discussed
elsewhere in this text; e.g., hyperventilation and hypothermia.
Chapter 11: The Underwater World124


1. One buddy dons a mask and sits on the bottom in
shallow water to check for leaks. The other buddy
assists by standing behind the first and applying
slight pressure on the shoulders to prevent floating.
If the fit is acceptable, the pupil looks toward the
underwater instructor, gives the underwater OK sign,
and then surfaces when the instructor gives the UP
sign (or before if needed).
2. The same buddy again sits on the bottom with the
mask watching the instructor, who gives the Watch
Me sign. The instructor deliberately floods his/her
mask by pulling it slightly away from the face. When
the mask is full, the instructor gives the OK sign, then
the UP sign. After everyone is standing facing the
instructor whose mask is full of water, the mask is
drained by pulling it slightly away from the face. The
pupils then do the exercise. This drill teaches the
pupils not to become alarmed if the mask floods, but
simply to surface and drain the water there. It also
shows the difference in vision when the mask is filled
with water rather than air. Once everyone is comfort-
able with the exercise, repeat 1 and 2 with the other
buddy. (Note: Purging the mask while submerged is
a scuba skill that may be shown as a bonus, but is
intentionally not required for Snorkeling BSA.)
3. Without the mask, one buddy bends over and
breathes through the snorkel. When tapped on
the shoulder by the other buddy on signal from the
instructor, the pupil squats to fill the snorkel with
water, returns to the facedown position, purges the
snorkel with a blast of air, and then carefully resumes
breathing. The exercise is repeated several times
before the other buddy is given a turn.
4. Without the mask or snorkel, one member of each
buddy team puts on fins, slips into the water, grasps
the side in a prone position, and makes slow, wide
kicks in place. Once adjusted to the flutter kick
with fins, the group walks backward away from the
poolside or dock, turns, and swims on the surface
using only the legs until reaching the other end of
the swimming area. The head is turned to the side for
air if needed. On the way back, have the group swim
part of the distance slightly underwater. Repeat with
the other set of buddies.
5. Repeat 4, this time with mask and snorkel.
6. Move to the deep end of the swimming area.
Demonstrate and practice a slide-in entry, a stride
entry, and exits at either the side or a ladder. For
the slide-in entry, the person puts on fins from a
sitting position on the poolside, dock, dive-boat swim
platform, or side of an inflatable and then slips into
the water using the arms for support.
Chapter 11: The Underwater World 125


For the stride entry into deep water, one leg is
extended over the water from a standing position
with one hand holding the mask in place. The legs
are brought together as they submerge. Have each
person give the surface OK sign after the stride
entry. To exit at the side or a ladder, the fins are first
removed and handed up.
7. With everyone sitting on the side at the deep end,
show how to pinch the nostrils through the mask.
Have everyone pinch their nose and blow gently until
their ears feel full. Have them repeat several times.
Then have one set of buddies slide into the water,
push down with one hand, and do the equalization
procedure underwater. Repeat with the other set
of buddies.
8. Demonstrate and practice headfirst and feetfirst
surface dives one set of buddies at a time, or
individually as needed. The arms lead the head during
a headfirst descent and during headfirst ascents.
9. Set out a dive flag and have buddies work together to
retrieve objects from the bottom, using DOWN signs
as appropriate.
10. Demonstrate and practice the displacement method
of clearing a snorkel. (Mastery of this method is not
required for Snorkeling BSA.)
11. Demonstrate the DISTRESS sign, followed by
demonstration and practice of floating and double
armpit tow.

Dive Physics
Light. Light rays entering the eye are focused on the
retina by the lens. However, with water rather than air
against the lens, light rays enter the eye at a slightly
different angle, and the lens has a hard time compensat-
ing. You can see underwater, but objects are out of focus.
A mask provides an air space in front of the eye so that
light bends as normal at the air-to-eye interface and the
eye can focus on underwater objects. However, now the
light rays bend entering the mask. The amount of bend-
ing is such that objects appear slightly larger and closer
than they would in air. Your mind normally is able to adjust
quickly to the differences.
Water molecules and suspended particles in the water
scatter and absorb light. The deeper you go, the darker
it gets, and colors become washed out. A dive light or
camera flash will reveal the true colors if the water is
clear. The effect is not pronounced enough to hide the
myriad colors of a tropical reef at depths easily reached
by snorkelers.
Sound. Sound travels about four times faster through
water than through air. You can hear well underwater and
for long distances. However, your ears use time differ-
ences to determine direction, and that ability is distorted
underwater. Your ears will warn you of an approaching
motorboat, but you may not know where it is coming from.
Also, sound bounces off layers with different velocity
and density. Because the speed of sound in air and
air density are both so much less than those of water,
sounds made above the surface probably won’t be heard
underwater. Therefore, you may not hear the whistle for
a buddy check until you surface. (That’s just one reason
why buddies should take turns underwater.)
Pressure. Your body is used to a pressure of one
atmosphere (the weight of the column of air from sea
level to outer space) of around 14 pounds per square
inch. Because water weighs much more than air, pres-
sure underwater increases rapidly with depth. Every
33 feet or so, you add another atmosphere, but you
may feel the difference at depths around 8 feet. As you
descend, the water pressure outside your chest squeezes
your lungs and raises the air pressure in them. If air is
free to travel from your lungs to your middle ear, the
pressure of the air on the inside of your eardrum will
match the pressure of the water on the outside. Your ears
won’t feel any pressure difference because there is none.
However, if the Eustachian tubes that connect your lungs
to your middle ear are blocked, the air pressure inside
your ear remains the same as that at the surface, and
pain will warn you of the mismatched pressure.
Some people can equal-
ize the pressure in their
ears simply by swallowing
or moving their jaw. Most
people will need to hold their
nose and blow gently to
move air through the Eusta-
chian tube into the middle
ear. That is why masks
allow you to hold your nose
from the outside. You can
check your ability to equal-
ize before a dive by holding your nose and blowing just
enough for your ears to feel momentarily stuffy. Such an
exercise may make it easier to later adjust underwater.
However, people congested with a cold or allergy may
not be able to equalize the pressure and should not try
hard to force it. You will still be able to enjoy snorkeling
near the surface; you just won’t be able to dive deeply.
Return to the surface whenever the pressure in your ears
warns you to do so.
Like your ears, your mask is another enclosed volume
of air that needs to adjust to pressure changes. Mask
“squeeze” is rare because the mask covers your nose,
and breathing through your nose will equalize the pres-
sure. By now you should understand why swim goggles
are not substitutes for a dive mask: there is no means
for pressure equalization. Some surface swimmers
also use earplugs to keep water out of their ears.
Snorkelers should not use earplugs since the pressure
during a surface dive may force them deeper into the
ear canal.
Many people correctly associate the bends, caused by
the release of gases dissolved in the blood, and other
hazards of scuba diving with changes in pressure.
However, breath-hold divers don’t have the same
concerns. If you dive to the bottom of a pool while
breathing from a scuba tank, you will need to clear your
ears, but the situation is different. The pressure in your
lungs goes up, not because they are squeezed, but
because your air supply is under pressure. You breathe
through a special valve, or regulator, that changes the
high air pressure in your tank to match what you need at
Chapter 11: The Underwater World128


a given depth. You need to release the pressure in your
lungs as you ascend to prevent damage. Scuba divers
should never hold their breath! Because skin divers don’t
overpressure their system from an external source, the
same problems don’t arise. That is one reason swimmers
are safe trying surface dives on their own, but should
never use scuba gear without qualified instruction.
Snorkeling Safety
Snorkeling Safety is the recommended procedure for con-
ducting BSA swimming activities using masks, fins, and
snorkels. Since snorkeling is a swimming activity, Safe Swim
Defense guidelines apply. Snorkeling Safety clarifies and
extends Safe Swim Defense concepts to situations encoun-
tered during training and open-water snorkeling.
1. Qualified Supervision
All swimming activity,
including snorkeling, must
be supervised by a mature
and conscientious adult age
21 or older who understands
and knowingly accepts
responsibility for the well-
being and safety of the youth
members in his or her care;
who is experienced in the water and confident of
his or her ability to respond in the event of an
emergency; and who is trained in and committed to
compliance with the eight points of BSA Safe
Swim Defense.
An experienced snorkeler must supervise snorkel-
ing instruction and open-water snorkeling activities.
At a minimum, the supervisor must possess skills
and knowledge matching the Snorkeling BSA
award, and have experience with environments
similar to those of the planned activity. The supervi-
sor is responsible for compliance with each point of
BSA Snorkeling Safety.
Unit leaders may rely on the expertise of other
adults to supplement their knowledge and
training. They may delegate the task of supervision,
for example, when the unit is participating in a
snorkeling activity conducted by a tour operator,
provided they are satisfied that the operator’s train-
ing and experience will provide a safe activity with
appropriate safeguards.
2. Personal Health Review
A complete health history is
required of all participants
as evidence of fitness for
snorkeling activities. Forms
for minors must be signed by
a parent. Participants should
be asked to relate any recent
incidents of illness or injury
just prior to the activity. Supervision and protection
should be adjusted to anticipate any potential risks
associated with individual health conditions. Recent
sinus or ear infections may temporarily preclude
surface dives while snorkeling. Those with known
adverse reactions to stings from marine life, or with
chronic conditions such as diabetes or asthma, may
need special medications at hand. Adults with known
risk factors for cardiovascular disease should not
undertake strenuous activities without the advice of
their physician. For significant health conditions, the
adult supervisor should require an examination by a
physician and should consult with parent, guardian,
or caregiver for appropriate precautions.
3. Safe Area
Training in the use of snor-
keling equipment shall be
performed in clear water in a
confined area that conforms
to Safe Swim Defense guide-
lines. “Clear water” implies
pool-like visibility. At a mini-
mum, an 8-inch disk with
white and black quadrants at a depth of 8 feet should
be recognizable from above the surface. “Confined
area” denotes either a pool or an established
summer camp swimming area with direct access
from the shore or a dock.
Safe conditions for open-water swimming and
snorkeling depend on water clarity, area definition,
depth, access, and other environmental factors.
Snorkeling is limited to clear water. “Open water”
denotes a temporary swimming area of flexible
extent in a natural body of water that may not be
close to shore.
Chapter 11: The Underwater World 129


An open-water snorkeling area need not have
physical boundary markers, but the activity should
be restricted within a specified distance of a point
onshore, an anchored vessel, a moving rescue craft,
or a float with a dive flag attached. Generally, a
50-foot radius is recommended, and may be dictated
by local regulations concerning the use of a dive flag.
The area covered by the snorkeling group should
be small enough to allow rapid assistance from
rescue personnel.
Emergency response places limitations on safe water
depth as well as water clarity and area. Response
personnel should be able to quickly and easily reach
the bottom, locate, recover, and transport a sub-
merged victim to shore or vessel. At the start of the
activity, and periodically if the group moves along a
reef or other feature, the response personnel should
check their ability to see and to reach the bottom. The
group should be directed toward shallower water
whenever the responders experience any difficulty.
(In Safe Swim Defense, 12 feet is designated as a
reasonable maximum depth. In practice, slightly shal-
lower or deeper depths may be appropriate. Different
personnel will be able to easily recover objects from
different depths, particularly if wearing fins. The prac-
tical way to confirm a safe depth is to test that the
bottom is within comfortable reach of all designated
rescue personnel.)
Limited or distant access to the snorkeling area may
require additional considerations. Underwater fea-
tures close to a sloping beach or near an anchored
vessel are ideal. If the snorkeling site is a consider-
able distance from a beach or permitted anchoring
location, the ability to rest becomes important and
may restrict the activity close to shallow water or
dictate the use of inflatable vests and/or small
response craft. Tide tables should be consulted in
areas with large tidal changes, especially when beach
access is at the base of a cliff. Snorkeling in a river
may require an exit point downstream of the entry.
Snorkeling should not be done if water depth, clar-
ity, or temperature; boat traffic; waves; or current,
weather, marine life, or bottom conditions, includ-
ing vegetation, are deemed unsafe by the qualified
supervisor. Time in the water should be adjusted
based on water temperature and sun exposure.
Snorkeling at night is limited to lighted pools unless
the activity is conducted at a BSA nationally accred-
ited high-adventure base.
4. Proper Equipment
A. All snorkeling equipment shall be properly fitted
and in good repair.
B. The use of inflatable snorkeling vests and per-
sonal flotation devices is at the discretion of
the qualified supervisor based on local condi-
tions and the abilities of the participants and
responders. Use of individual flotation devices
is required in open water whenever there is a
noticeable current or swells, when the bottom
is not visible from the surface (due to vegetation
or limited visibility beyond 8 feet), or when the
activity is an extended distance (greater than
50 yards) from shore or craft.
C. A dive flag should be used at all open-water sites.
It may be displayed from a dive boat or attached
to a float and towed with the snorkeling party.
Local rules and regulations may specify the type
of flag and how close snorkelers must stay to it.
D. Protective clothing may be worn. Gloves are
appropriate in areas with sharp rocks or
encrusted structures. A shirt or a diver’s bodysuit
will provide limited protection from sun, abrasion,
or coral burns and minor insulation in warm water.
In temperate water, a partial or full wet suit may
be worn. Weight belts may not be used.
E. Lifesaving equipment in good repair shall be
ready for immediate use by response personnel.
A flotation device is recommended, such
as a rescue tube, bodyboard, or life jacket,
supplemented, as appropriate, by reaching and
throwing devices and small craft. Dive boats
should be equipped with radios and first aid kits,
and should deploy a safety line.
Chapter 11: The Underwater World130


5. Response Personnel
(lifeguards and lookout)
It is the responsibility of the qualified supervisor
to designate personnel for emergency response
whenever lifeguards are not provided by a facility
or tour operator. The snorkeling party should be
divided into groups of two to eight swimmers with
two responders, paired as buddies, assigned to each
group. (Units may be divided by patrols or crews.)
The responders should be competent swimmers with
basic water-rescue skills. Emergency procedures,
including entries, exits, and the role of everyone in the
group, should be reviewed and practiced before the
activity using rescue aids at the site. The responders
should be stationed either afloat or ashore where they
can see and hear all those in their group. Neither the
responders nor the swimmers should face into the
sun to see the other. Snorkelers in a group should
remain off the same side of a vessel. Inflatable or
rigid dinghies with oars are appropriate response
craft. The responders and snorkelers should remain
close enough for rapid rescue, generally within 50
feet of one another. In some situations, the qualified
supervisor may deem it appropriate for the responders
to tow rescue aids while accompanying their group in
the water.
Responders are responsible for surveillance as well
as rescue. If there is more than one group, then a
separate lookout, who may be the qualified supervi-
sor, should coordinate the entire activity and monitor
changing conditions. The lookout should have audible
or visible means, such as an air horn or flag, to recall
all groups. If a boat is used to transport snorkelers to
the site, then at least one person should remain aboard
who knows how to drive the boat and use the radio.
A least one person in the party must be trained in CPR.
It is the combined responsibility of the adult super-
visor, the lookout, and the responders to know the
number of people in the water at all times and to
make frequent visible confirmations of that number.
Buddy boards and tags, or their equivalent, must be
used to account for everyone in the water.
6. Ability
Only those who have
completed the Snorkeling
BSA requirements may
participate in open-water
snorkeling. Scouts classified
as beginners or nonswimmers
may use snorkeling equip-
ment in clear, confined water
of appropriate depth, as specified in Safe Swim
Defense (points 3 and 6), during instructional swims
or during closely supervised recreational activity.
Training for the Snorkeling BSA award is limited to
Scouts and adults classified as swimmers.
7. Buddy System
All participants in snorkel-
ing activities are paired as
buddies. Buddies should
check each other’s equip-
ment prior to the activity and
review hand signals. During
the activity, they remain
close enough that they are
constantly aware of their buddy’s location and condi-
tion. Generally, buddies should take turns making
breath-holding dives. That is, one buddy remains at
the surface, floating with his mask in the water while
breathing through the snorkel, and keeps an eye on
the buddy who is down. When the diver surfaces,
both buddies check their position relative to the group
before moving on or letting the other buddy dive.
The adult supervisor, lookout, or responders may
call buddy checks as needed to keep the buddies
together. Buddy checks may also be called to aid
communication. Buddy pairs should be instructed
to routinely watch for predetermined audible and
visual signals of a buddy check.
Chapter 11: The Underwater World 131


8. Discipline
Be sure everyone under-
stands and agrees that snor-
keling is allowed only with
proper supervision and use of
the complete Safe Swim
Defense and BSA Snorkeling
Safety standards. The appli-
cable rules should be pre-
sented and learned before the outing, and should be
reviewed for all participants at the beginning of the
snorkeling activity. Scouts should respect and follow all
directions and rules of the adult supervisor. When
people know the reason for rules and procedures, they
are more likely to follow them. Treatment should be
strict and fair, without favoritism.
Scuba
Swimming underwater using a compressed air source
involves the use of sophisticated equipment. Simple
actions, such as holding the breath, can be hazardous.
Despite such complications, scuba activities as a whole
have an excellent safety record. That record can be
attributed to quality training programs adopted by the
industry. Scouting relies on such training to provide safe
scuba opportunities for its members.
Scuba training has several lev-
els. Basic introductory experi-
ences are conducted in pools
with a small number of partici-
pants supervised by a certified
instructor. Those completing such
courses are given a taste of the
sport under controlled conditions
but are not prepared to dive on their own. Scuba BSA
for qualified Scouts, Scouters, and Venturers is such a
program. Requirements are found in the Scuba BSA
brochure, No. 430-515, which is also available online at
www.scouting.org.
Slightly more advanced introductory courses conclude
with an open-water dive under close supervision. Open-
water dives are not an option for Scuba BSA.
Open-water certification courses provide the train-
ing needed for independent diving with a buddy and are
normally required before a person is allowed to fill or rent
tanks. Numerous tour operators and
dive shops arrange group dive trips
for people so certified. Standard
open-water certification is offered
only to those over a certain age.
Junior diver certification is available
for those below that age. Boy Scouts
may obtain open-water certification as part of the Scuba
Diving merit badge. Venturing groups may participate
in scuba certification programs, appropriate to their age
and current level of certification, that are conducted by
recognized agencies.
Many recreational specialty courses are available to those
with open-water certification. These include underwater
photography, wreck diving, cave diving, cold-water diving,
and diver rescue. Divers with a sufficient number of logged
dives and additional training may qualify for a divemaster
rating. Divemaster is the minimum qualification needed by
the dive supervisor when certified divers engage in unit
dives during Scouting activities.
All scuba instruction must be conducted by certified
scuba instructors. Units that are interested in scuba
training can find Scout camps that offer training
programs under the high-adventure listing on the
BSA website: www.scouting.org. The Florida National
High Adventure Sea Base, www.bsaseabase.org, offers
scuba training and dive programs. Training may also be
arranged through local PADI, NAUI, SSI, IDEA, PDIC, or
SDI dive shops. The use of other dive training agencies is
authorized under conditions found in the complete BSA
scuba policy statement that follows.
Scuba certification requires a level of preparation
for underwater diving that the BSA seeks for surface
swimming via Safe Swim Defense and skill instruc-
tion. Every certified scuba diver has the knowledge,
skills, and experience to recognize and minimize envi-
ronmental risks, to move safely through the water,
and to aid a buddy in distress. Drownings during rec-
reational swimming would all but disappear if every
member of the swimming public knew and observed
basic safety rules, could swim well, and knew simple
rescue techniques for themselves and others.
Chapter 11: The Underwater World132


BSA Scuba Policy
The BSA scuba policy recognizes scuba industry standards
and implements them by using outside agencies for training
and certification.
Training and Supervision
Any person possessing, displaying, or using scuba (self-
contained underwater breathing apparatus) in connection
with any Scouting-related activity must be either currently
certified by a recognized agency or enrolled in an
instructional scuba program, such as Scuba BSA or the
Scuba Diving merit badge, which must be conducted by
an insured recreational diving instructor in good standing
with a recognized agency and approved by the council.
Recreational diving activities by BSA groups must be
supervised by a responsible adult currently certified (renewed)
as a divemaster, assistant instructor, or higher rating from a
recognized agency. Dive environments, equipment, depths,
procedures, supervision, and buddy assignments must be
consistent with each individual’s certification.
Because dives by recreational divers may be infrequent,
the divemaster or instructor supervising a BSA scuba
activity should screen participants prior to open-water
activities and provide remedial instruction and practice
as appropriate. Such remedial instruction and practice
should be in accordance with the policies and standards
of the divemaster’s or instructor’s agency for Scuba
Review, Scuba Refresher, or similar program.
Diving using surface-supplied air systems is not
authorized in connection with any BSA activity or facility
except when done under contract by commercial divers.
Age-Appropriate Restrictions
Youth members in Cub Scouting, including Webelos
Scouts, are not authorized to use scuba in any activity.
Boy Scouts may participate in the introductory Scuba
BSA program and may obtain open-water certification as
part of the Scuba Diving merit badge.
Venturing groups may participate in introductory and
certification scuba programs conducted by recognized
agencies appropriate to their age and current level
of certification.
Standards of the recognized scuba agencies require
students for open-water certification programs to be
at least 15 years of age but allow special certification
programs for younger students. Since all instruction for
BSA scuba programs must be conducted by professionals
certified by a recognized agency, additional agency-
specific, age-related restrictions and protocols apply to
students under 15 years of age.
Boy Scouts and Venturers may participate in recreational
group dives as unit, district, or council activities, provided
such dives are consistent with their certifications and under
direct, on-site supervision of a responsible adult currently
certified as a divemaster, assistant instructor, or higher
rating from a recognized agency.
The divemaster or instructor supervising a recreational
dive by a BSA group must implement the following
policies for all divers under 15 years of age, as well as any
additional junior diver restrictions and protocols adopted
by that person’s certifying agency:
• Depths are limited to 40 feet for divers under 12 years
of age and to 60 feet for divers 12 to 14 years of age.
• Each diver under 15 years of age must have an adult
buddy certified as an open-water diver who is either the
junior diver’s parent or an adult approved by the parent.
• Additional divemasters or instructors are present
to maintain a ratio of one trained supervisor to four
buddy pairs (eight divers) containing one to four div-
ers under 15 years of age.
Medical Contraindications
Each scuba training agency recognized by the BSA
requires a specific health history form prior to enrollment
in a certification program. The BSA requires review and
approval of the completed form by a physician even
if the scuba agency itself does not require physician
approval. Various risk factors identified on the forms may
exclude a person from scuba training, either temporarily
or permanently. Risk factors include, but are not limited
to, ear and sinus problems, recent surgery, spontaneous
pneumothorax, asthma or reactive airway disease (RAD),
seizure disorders, diabetes, leukemia, sickle-cell disorder,
pregnancy, panic disorders, and active psychosis.
The divemaster or instructor supervising a BSA recreational
scuba activity must review the health information for each
Chapter 11: The Underwater World 133


participant that is required annually of all BSA members and
evaluate risk conditions using medical standards consistent
with those used by his or her certifying agency. Additional
tests or physician consultations may be required to confirm
fitness for diving. Consultation with medical specialists
knowledgeable about diving medicine also may be needed
for participants taking psychotropic drugs for treatment of
attention deficit disorder, depression, or other conditions.
Scuba diving is prohibited for the following conditions.
• Use of medication to control seizures or seizure
occurrence within the past five years
• Use of insulin to control diabetes
• History of asthma or RAD unless resolution confirmed
by methacholine testing (Persons who have been
asymptomatic and medication free for the previous
five years are exempt from the methacholine testing
requirements.)
The scuba agencies recognized by the BSA may allow
exceptions to general medical prohibitions based on
individual diving fitness evaluations by a medical
specialist who is knowledgeable about diving medicine.
Scouts, parents, dive supervisors, and physicians with
questions or concerns about diving with specific medical
conditions should consult the Recreational Scuba
Training Council (RSTC) Guidelines for Recreational
Scuba Diver’s Physical Examination and the Divers Alert
Network (DAN) at www.diversalertnetwork.org. DAN
medical professionals are available for nonemergency
consultation by telephone at 919-684-2948 during business
hours or via email.
Council Programs
When scuba diving is taught in connection with any local
council program, instructors should provide the training on a
contract basis. Such instructors should have dive store or
other commercial affiliation that provides liability insurance
coverage. Direct employment of scuba instructors is
not recommended.
Local council programs may not compress or sell air for
scuba use, or sell, rent, or loan scuba equipment (scuba
cylinders, regulators, gauges, dive computers, weights,
or BCDs). All air and equipment for local council program
use must be obtained from professional sources (dive
stores, resorts, dive boats, etc.) affiliated with a scuba
agency recognized by the BSA.
Scuba equipment may be used by certified summer camp
aquatics program personnel for installation and
maintenance of waterfront equipment, or for search and
recovery operations. Search and recovery could include
lost equipment, as well as rescue efforts.
Recognized Agencies
Recognized agencies are:
• PADI: Professional Association of Diving Instructors
• NAUI: National Association of Underwater Instructors
• SSI: Scuba Schools International
• IDEA: International Diving Educators Association
• PDIC: Professional Diving Instructors Corporation
• SDI: Scuba Diving International
• YMCA Scuba Program (discontinued in 2008, but
certification cards are still recognized)
• NASDS: National Association of Scuba Diving
Schools (merged with SSI, but certification cards are
still recognized)
In addition to the agencies listed by name, any
current member of the World Recreational Scuba Training
Council (WRSTC), which includes all RSTC members, is
also recognized.
Other agencies wishing to be recognized by the BSA may
contact the Outdoor Programs Team of the national office.
Recognition by a certifying body such as the RSTC or EUF
that the agency adheres to ANSI/CEN/ISO standards
would be expected.

Safety Afloat
All boating activities in Scouting are required to follow the nine basic principles known collectively as Safety Afloat.
During the 1970s, public interest in river canoeing experienced a huge surge in popularity with a corresponding increase
in the number of fatalities. Scouting’s response was to devise a set of safety guidelines for float trips based on the
successful Safe Swim Defense plan. The emphasis is on accident prevention through proper preparation and skill.
A unit that follows Safety Afloat can expect a safe, enjoyable experience.
A summary of Safety Afloat appears in Chapter 3. The complete text is given here in bold type with additional explanatory
material in regular print.
Chapter
12


Chapter 12: Safety Afloat146
BSA groups shall use
Safety Afloat for all boat-
ing activities. Adult lead-
ers supervising activities
afloat must have com-
pleted Safety Afloat train-
ing within the previous
two years. Cub Scout
activities afloat are limited
to council, district, pack,
or den events that do not
include moving water or
float trips (expeditions).
Safety Afloat standards apply to the use of canoes, kay-
aks, rowboats, rafts, floating tubes, sailboats, motorboats
(including waterskiing), and other small craft, but do not
apply to transportation on large commercial vessels such
as ferries and cruise ships. Parasailing (being towed air-
borne behind a boat using a parachute), kitesurfing (using
a wakeboard towed by a kite), and unit-level recreational
use of personal watercraft (small sit-on-top motorboats
propelled by water jets) are not authorized BSA activities.
Safety Afloat training may be obtained from my.scouting.org,
at council summer camps, and at other council and district
training events. Additional guidance on appropriate skill
levels and training resources is provided in the Aquatics
Supervision guide available from council service centers.
1. Qualified Supervision
All activity afloat must be supervised by a mature and
conscientious adult age 21 or older who understands
and knowingly accepts responsibility for the well-being
and safety of those in his or her care and who is trained
in and committed to compliance with the nine points of
BSA Safety Afloat. That supervisor must be skilled in the
safe operation of the craft for the specific activity, knowl-
edgeable in accident prevention, and prepared for emer-
gency situations. If the adult with Safety Afloat training
lacks the necessary boat operating and safety skills, he
or she may serve as the supervisor only if assisted by
other adults, camp staff personnel, or professional tour
guides who have the appropriate skills. Additional lead-
ership is provided in ratios of one trained adult, staff
member, or guide per 10 participants. For Cub Scouts,
the leadership ratio is one trained adult, staff member, or
guide per five participants. At least one leader must be
trained in first aid including CPR. Any swimming done in
conjunction with the activity afloat must be supervised
in accordance with BSA Safe Swim Defense standards.
It is strongly recommended that all units have at least
one adult or older youth member currently trained in BSA
Aquatics Supervision: Paddle Craft Safety to assist in the
planning and conduct of all activities afloat.
The purpose of this publication is to provide the unit
leader with sufficient information to confidently know
when he or she meets the expectations set forth in the
first point. This book also serves as the text for training in
BSA Paddle Craft Safety.
2. Personal Health Review
A complete health history is required of all participants
as evidence of fitness for boating activities. Forms for
minors must be signed by a parent or legal guardian.
Participants should be asked to relate any recent inci-
dents of illness or injury just prior to the activity. Super-
vision and protection should be adjusted to anticipate
any potential risks associated with individual health
conditions. For significant health conditions, the adult
supervisor should require an examination by a physician
and consult with parent, guardian, or caregiver for
appropriate precautions.
This important item is shared with Safe Swim Defense
and was covered in Chapter 4.
3. Swimming Ability
Operation of any boat on a float trip is limited to youth
and adults who have completed the BSA swimmer clas-
sification test. Swimmers must complete the following
test, which should be administered annually:
Jump feetfirst into water over the head in depth. Level
off and swim 75 yards in a strong manner using one or
more of the following strokes: sidestroke, breaststroke,
trudgen, or crawl; then swim 25 yards using an easy,
resting backstroke. The 100 yards must be completed in
one swim without stops and must include at least one
sharp turn. After completing the swim, rest by floating.
1. Qualified Supervision. All activity afloat must be supervised by
a mature and conscientious adult age 21 or older who under-
stands and knowingly accepts responsibility for the well-being
and safety of those in his or her care, and who is trained and
committed to compliance with the nine points of BSA Safety
Afloat. That supervisor must be skilled in the safe operation of
the craft, knowledgeable in accident prevention, and prepared
for emergency situations. Additional leadership is provided
in ratios of 1 to 5 for Cub Scouts and 1 to 10 for Boy Scouts
and Venturers. At least one leader must be trained in CPR. It is
strongly recommended that all units have at least one member
trained in BSA Paddle Craft Safety to assist in activity afloat.
2. Personal Health Review. Adjust supervision to anticipate any
potential risks identified by review of required health histories.
3. Swimming Ability. Operation of any boat is limited to those
who have completed the BSA swimmer classification test.
Those not classified as swimmers may ride as passengers
on calm water when there is little chance of capsizing or
falling overboard.
4. Personal Flotation Equipment. Approved, properly fitted PFDs
must be worn by all persons engaged in boating activity.


Chapter 12: Safety Afloat 147
For activity afloat, those not classified as a swimmer are
limited to multiperson craft during outings or float trips
on calm water with little likelihood of capsizing or falling
overboard. They may operate a fixed-seat rowboat or
pedal boat accompanied by a buddy who is a swimmer.
They may paddle or ride in a canoe or other paddle craft
with an adult swimmer skilled in that craft as a buddy.
They may ride as part of a group on a motorboat or sailboat
operated by a skilled adult.
Note that this directive allows flexibility for those with
poor swimming skills to participate, primarily as passen-
gers, in various situations. However, only swimmers may
participate in whitewater activities.
4. Life Jackets
Properly fitted U.S. Coast Guard–approved life jackets
must be worn by all persons engaged in boating activity
(rowing, canoeing, sailing, boardsailing, motorboating,
waterskiing, rafting, tubing, and kayaking). Type III life
jackets are recommended for general recreational use.
For vessels over 20 feet in length, life jackets need not be
worn when participants are below deck or on deck when
the qualified supervisor aboard the vessel determines that
it is prudent to abide by less-restrictive state and federal
regulations concerning the use and storage of life jackets,
for example, when a cruising vessel with safety rails is at
anchor. All participants not classified as swimmers must
wear a life jacket when on deck under way.
Life jackets need not be worn when an activity falls
under Safe Swim Defense guidelines—for example,
when an inflated raft is used in a pool or when snorkel-
ing from an anchored craft.
Life jackets with tears and inoperable buckles do not
meet Coast Guard standards. Proper fit, including correct
sizing and fastening, is just as important as Coast Guard
approval. The next chapter provides additional information
on life jacket selection, fit, and use.
5. Buddy System
All participants in an activity afloat are paired as bud-
dies who are always aware of each other’s situation and
prepared to sound an alarm and lend assistance imme-
diately when needed. When several craft are used on a
float trip, each boat on the water should have a “buddy
boat.” All buddy pairs must be accounted for at regular
intervals during the activity and checked off the water by
the qualified supervisor at the conclusion of the activity.
Buddies either ride in the same boat or stay near one
another in single-person craft.
Buddy tags and boards are often used at BSA summer
camps where boating is done in a limited area with the same
launch and landing site. That specific tracking system is not
required for a unit float trip, but the unit leader must have an
unambiguous means to ensure that everyone who ventures
on the water also gets off the water when expected.
6. Skill Proficiency
Everyone in an activity afloat must have sufficient knowl-
edge and skill to participate safely. Passengers should
know how their movement affects boat stability and have
a basic understanding of self-rescue. Boat operators must
meet government requirements, be able to maintain control
of their craft, know how changes in the environment
influence that control, and undertake activities only that are
within their personal and group capabilities.
• Content of training exercises should be appropriate
for the age, size, and experience of the participants,
and should cover basic skills on calm water of limited
extent before proceeding to advanced skills involv-
ing current, waves, high winds, or extended distance.
At a minimum, instructors for canoes and kayaks
should be able to demonstrate the handling and
rescue skills required for BSA Aquatics Supervision:
Paddle Craft Safety. All instructors must have at
least one assistant who can recognize and respond
appropriately if the instructor’s safety is compromised.
• Anyone engaged in recreational boating using human-
powered craft on flat-water ponds or controlled lake
areas free of conflicting activities should be instructed
in basic safety procedures prior to launch, and allowed
to proceed after they have demonstrated the ability to
control the boat adequately to return to shore at will.


Chapter 12: Safety Afloat148
• For recreational sailing, at least one person aboard
should be able to demonstrate basic sailing proficiency
(tacking, reaching, and running) sufficient to return
the boat to the launch point. Extended cruising on a
large sailboat requires either a professional captain
or an adult with sufficient experience to qualify as a
bareboat skipper.
• Motorboats may be operated by youth, subject to state
requirements, only when accompanied in the boat by
an experienced leader or camp staff member who
meets state requirements for motorboat operation.
Extended cruising on a large powerboat requires
either a professional captain or an adult with similar
qualifications.
• Before a unit using human-powered craft controlled by
youth embarks on a float trip or excursion that covers an
extended distance or lasts longer than four hours, each
participant should receive either a minimum of three
hours’ training and supervised practice or demonstrate
proficiency in maneuvering the craft effectively over a
100-yard course and recovering from a capsize.
• Self-guided unit trips on Class III white water may
only be done after all participants have received
American Canoe Association or equivalent training
for the class of water and type of craft involved. Unit
trips on whitewater sections of rivers rated Class
IV are only allowed in rafts with a professionally
trained guide in each raft. Trips above Class IV are
not allowed.
Skill is an important component for an enjoyable, safe
activity afloat. Because skills must be learned, Safety
Afloat provides for novice participation in a controlled,
safe teaching environment with progressively more skill
expected as the participant moves to independent control
of the craft in a remote setting. The specific skills required
for different craft in various situations are too diverse to
detail in a general policy statement. Instead, Safety Afloat
depends on unit leadership’s prior awareness of skill levels
appropriate for an activity. Leaders without that awareness
must recruit experienced assistants with such knowledge
to supervise an event afloat.
7. Planning
Proper planning is necessary to ensure a safe, enjoyable
exercise afloat. All plans should include a scheduled
itinerary, notification of appropriate parties, communication
arrangements, contingencies in case of foul weather or
equipment failure, and emergency response options.
• Preparation. Any boating activity requires access to
the proper equipment and transportation of gear and
participants to the site. Determine what state and
local regulations are applicable. Get permission to
use or cross private property. Determine whether per-
sonal resources will be used or whether outfitters will
supply equipment, food, and shuttle services. Lists of
group and personal equipment and supplies must be
compiled and checked. Even short trips require select-
ing a route, checking water levels, and determining
alternative pull-out locations. Changes in water level,
especially on moving water, may pose significant,
variable safety concerns. Obtain current charts and


Chapter 12: Safety Afloat 149
information about the waterway and consult those
who have traveled the route recently.
• Float Plan. Complete the preparation by writing a
detailed itinerary, or float plan, noting put-in and
pull-out locations and waypoints, along with the
approximate time the group should arrive at each.
Travel time should be estimated generously.
• Notification. File the float plan with parents, the
local council office if traveling on running water,
and local authorities if appropriate. Assign a mem-
ber of the unit committee to alert authorities if prear-
ranged check-ins are overdue. Make sure everyone
is promptly notified when the trip is concluded.
• Weather. Check the weather forecast just before
setting out, and keep an alert weather eye. Antici-
pate changes and bring all craft ashore when rough
weather threatens. Wait at least 30 minutes before
resuming activities after the last incidence of
thunder or lightning.
• Contingencies. Planning must identify possible
emergencies and other circumstances that could
force a change of plans. Develop alternative
plans for each situation. Identify local emergency
resources such as EMS systems, sheriff’s depart-
ments, or ranger stations. Check your primary com-
munication system, and identify backups, such as
the nearest residence to a campsite. Cell phones
and radios may lose coverage, run out of power, or
suffer water damage.
This item reinforces the Scout motto: Be Prepared.
8. Equipment
All craft must be suitable for the activity, seaworthy, and
float if capsized. All craft and equipment must meet regu-
latory standards, be properly sized, and be in good repair.
Spares, repair materials, and emergency gear must be
carried as appropriate. Life jackets and paddles must be
sized to the participants. Properly designed and fitted
helmets must be worn when running rapids rated Class
II and above. Emergency equipment such as throw bags,
signal devices, flashlights, heat sources, first aid kits,
radios, and maps must be ready for use. Spare equip-
ment, repair materials, extra food and water, and dry
clothes should be appropriate for the activity. All gear
should be stowed to prevent loss and water damage.


Chapter 12: Safety Afloat150
For float trips with multiple craft, the number of craft
should be sufficient to carry the party if a boat is
disabled, and critical supplies should be divided
among the craft.
Proper equipment depends on the kind of craft as well
as the type and duration of the activity. Someone who
has conducted a similar activity should be a valuable
resource—experience is hard to beat.
9. Discipline
Rules are effective only when followed. All participants
should know, understand, and respect the rules and
procedures for safe boating activities provided by Safety
Afloat guidelines. Applicable rules should be discussed
prior to the outing and reviewed for all participants
near the boarding area just before the activity afloat
begins. People are more likely to follow directions
when they know the reasons for rules and procedures.
Consistent, impartially applied rules supported by skill
and good judgment provide stepping stones to a safe,
enjoyable outing.
Like the bread that holds together a sandwich, discipline
and qualified supervision are the foundation and cover
that make safe Scouting a reality. Scouts are accustomed
to following rules in other situations and will likely also be
well-behaved during boating events. That is particularly
true if the Scouts are reminded of their dual responsi-
bility for their own safety and that of others in the unit.
Youth leaders should share in decisions and guidance.
However, youthful exuberance may at times cause
momentary lapses in attention. That is, fun and a sense
of adventure can overwhelm common sense. Dealing
with such situations is a learning experience for youth
and leaders, but leaders should realize that youngsters
cannot always be expected to act rationally in the interest
of their own safety. Adult leaders should therefore accept
that they, not the Scouts, are ultimately responsible for
implementing BSA rules and procedures.


Life Jackets
State regulations often mandate life jacket use. Where state laws do not exist, federal law requires that children under
the age of 13 wear a life jacket on a recreational boat unless the child is below deck, in an enclosed cabin, or if the
boat is not under way. An appropriate, easily accessible life jacket must be carried for all adults, including those towed
behind the craft. BSA policy is more stringent: Properly fitted U.S. Coast Guard–approved life jackets must be
worn by all persons engaged in boating activity.
Chapter
13


Chapter 13: Life Jackets152
Designs
Life jackets are divided into five categories. Types I, II, III,
and V are worn. Type IV indicates a throwing device.
Type I—Offshore Life Jacket
These life jackets are generally used as emergency
devices on commercial vessels. They are effective for all
waters, especially open, rough, or remote waters where
rescue may be delayed. They will turn most unconscious
people faceup. The inherently buoyant styles are generally
too bulky for recreational activities. Inflatable and hybrid
styles are available. Hybrid styles combine fixed flotation
material with air inflation.
Type II—Nearshore Buoyant Vest
These life jackets will turn some unconscious persons
faceup. They are intended for calm, inland water, or
where the chance of quick rescue is good. The familiar
horse-collar styles are generally less expensive than
any other type. However, they often are uncomfortable
for extended wear and may interfere with some recre-
ational activities. Inflatable and hybrid styles are avail-
able but are expensive. Some Type II life jackets designed
for small children are appropriate flotation devices for
swimming activities as well as boating. Note the crotch
strap and handle on the child version.
Type III—Flotation Aid
These life jackets are designed to help wearers achieve
and maintain a faceup position in the water. They come
in a wide variety of comfortable styles that allow a good
range of motion. They are generally best for recreational
use. Prices vary from economical to expensive.


Chapter 13: Life Jackets 153
Type V—Special-Use Device
The various special-use life jackets are designed for the
specific industrial and recreational situations indicated
on their labels. Some are multipurpose; that is, a jacket
labeled Type V for whitewater use may also serve as a
Type III for other uses.
Inflatable and hybrid life jackets may be found in any of the
wearable categories. Inflatable devices must be worn to
qualify for Coast Guard approval, and are not authorized
for use for those less than 16 years of age. That limits their
use in Scouting.
Type IV—Throwable Devices
These personal flotation devices may be thrown to
boaters in need. They are to be grasped by a swimmer,
not worn. In addition to a wearable life jacket for
everyone aboard, federal requirements mandate a Type
IV throwable device on any boat 16 feet or longer except
canoes, kayaks, and rowing shells.
Size
Life jackets come in
Adult, Youth, Child, and
Infant sizes. Check
the life jacket label for
the appropriate weight
range. Note: A life
jacket whose label is
illegible is no longer
Coast Guard–approved.


Chapter 13: Life Jackets154
Fit
A life jacket must be worn with all straps and zippers
properly fastened. Pull adjustable straps until the life
jacket fits snugly, but comfortably, over clothing worn for
different weather conditions. A properly fitted life jacket
will not ride up around the head when lifted by the shoul-
der straps or supporting a person in the water. If it does, a
smaller size is needed. Simply tightening the straps on an
adult life jacket will not make it safe for a child.
Condition
Sun exposure can weaken life jacket materials.
If strap attachments are torn, buckles are inoperable, or
foam material is exposed, the life jacket or flotation aid is
no longer safe, nor approved. Destroy it to prevent use.


Chapter 13: Life Jackets 155
Dynamic Strength Testing
Life jackets designed for waterskiing and other situa-
tions where impact with the water is likely are reinforced,
typically with three straps that circle the vest. Check the
label to see that the life jacket is rated for those activities.
Inflatables are not. Note: A life jacket with a strength
rating does not mean that the life jacket protects the
wearer from injury.

Years ago, the U.S. Coast Guard adopted the generic designation “personal floatation device” in lieu of older
terms such as “life jacket,” “life vest,” or “life preserver.” The PFD acronym was generally recognized by the
paddling community, but not necessarily by the public at large. The Coast Guard Office of Boating Safety and
the National Safe Boating Council have phased out “PFD” in favor of “life jacket” in safety literature. “PFD” still
appears in various regulations.


Chapter 13: Life Jackets156
Wear a life jacket:
It’s policy and it’s the SMART thing to do!
Statistics
According to an American Canoe Association brochure,
victims in 85 percent of canoeing fatalities and
48 percent of kayaking fatalities were not
wearing a life jacket.


Cold-Water Survival
Be Prepared
COLD WATER CAN KILL. Water sucks heat from your body 30 times faster than air. If your core body temperature
drops just 3.5 degrees you will experience hypothermia, which can be deadly. Water that is even slightly below your core
body temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit can be dangerous. Your survival time greatly depends on the temperature of
the water, your physical condition, and your personal preparation. In water near freezing, an unprotected swimmer may
be physically impaired almost immediately and may die in as little as 15 minutes unless removed from the water and
properly treated.
Chapter
14


Chapter 14: Cold-Water Survival158
Cold Shock is a dangerous, sometimes fatal, condition
that can result when a person is suddenly immersed in
cold water, such as would occur in a capsize. The sudden
exposure of the head and chest to cold water typically
causes an involuntary gasp for air, sudden increases in
heart rate and blood pressure, and disorientation, and
can possibly cause cardiac arrest.
Hypothermia results when the body can no longer main-
tain its normal temperature. In an attempt to protect the
core (heart, lungs, and brain), the body systematically
begins to shut down. Judgment and coordination are
adversely affected. Eventually, death can result. One of the
best indicators that someone is becoming hypothermic is
if they begin to shiver uncontrollably while at rest. Being at
rest is an important factor because the body heat produced
by the exercise of paddling tends to temporarily mask
the onset of hypothermia. Take frequent breaks where
everyone stops exercising and use this time to check
whether anyone is shivering.
Prevent
Plan your trip:
• Know the water temperature before you set out.
• Always wear your life jacket.
• Paddle near to shore and/or near others who can
help you in the event of capsize.
• Paddle with others and ensure that all participants
know the signs and symptoms of hypothermia.
Fuel your body:
• Keep your body well fueled with high-carbohydrate
foods and lots of water.
• Remember, your body expends calories to maintain
your core temperature as well as to provide energy
to your muscles.
Insulate your body:
• Avoid wearing cotton clothing when paddling in cool
temperatures.
• Dress in layers using synthetic fabrics such as poly-
ester fleece to prevent getting overheated or chilled
from perspiration.
• Carry a waterproof jacket designed for splash and/or
rain protection.
• Anytime the water temperature is less than
60 degrees Fahrenheit, wear specialized insulating
clothing capable of protecting you while in the water.
• You should always wear a wet suit or dry suit:
1. If the air temperature and water temperature
combined is less than 120 degrees,
2. If you will be far from shore in cold water, or
3. Anytime in cool or mild weather when you expect
to be repeatedly exposed to cold water.
Keep in mind that the warmth and comfort range of a dry
suit can be flexible based on the clothing worn under-
neath it. Some people wear clothes underneath their wet
suits, but this defeats the insulating ability of the wet suit,
which is to create a microclimate of water next to the
skin. Studies have shown that the number one criterion
in determining the insulating capability of a wet suit is its
ability to trap the water. Wearing clothes beneath your
wet suit allows a lot of water movement and, hence,
heat loss.
• Wear a warm hat that will stay on your head in the
water. A fleece-lined skullcap is ideal.
• Have spare, dry clothing and store in a sealed dry
bag while on the water.
• Test your protective clothing in a controlled cold-
water environment to understand the level of protec-
tion provided.

Chapter 14: Cold-Water Survival 159
Watch your group:
• Know your emotional and physical limitations.
Group members need to constantly assess the
behavior of others in their group. Look for changes in
behavior: withdrawal, sluggishness, talking less, or a
member not eating enough. These are all symptoms
of fatigue and may suggest a problem that the group
needs to address.
Assess
The most typical symptoms of hypothermia in general
order of onset are:
1. Shivering
2. Impaired judgment
3. Clumsiness
4. Loss of dexterity
5. Slurred speech
6. Inward behavior (withdrawal, apathy, lethargy)
7. Shivering stops
8. Muscle rigidity
9. Unconsciousness
10. Death
Treat
Mild hypothermia
(victim shivering but coherent):
Move victim to place of warmth. Remove wet clothes;
give warm, sweet drinks, no alcohol or caffeine. Keep vic-
tim warm for several hours. The “window of opportunity”
is closing fast. By this time you are already well on your
way to experiencing hypothermia.
(If possible, take action before this stage. You may
still have time to either stop the trip or take out early.
Planning for an early takeout and/or shuttle halfway
pays dividends.)
Moderate hypothermia
(shivering may decrease or stop):
Victim may seem irrational with deteriorating coordination.
Treat the same as above but no drinks. Victim should be
kept lying down with torso, thighs, head, and neck covered
with dry clothes, coats, or blankets to stop further heat
loss. Seek medical attention immediately.
Severe hypothermia
(shivering may have stopped):
Victim may resist help or be semiconscious or unconscious.
Removed from water, victim should be kept lying flat,
on back, and immobile. Victim should be handled gen-
tly. Cover torso, thighs, head, and neck with dry covers to
stop further heat loss. Monitor vital signs. Seek medical
attention immediately.
Victim appears dead
(little or no breathing, no pulse, body rigid):
Assume victim can still be revived. Look for faint pulse
or breathing for two minutes. If any trace is found, do
not give CPR. It can cause cardiac arrest. Medical help
is imperative. If pulse and breathing are totally absent,
trained personnel should start CPR.

survival brochure that is part of the American Canoe
Association’s Paddle Safe, Paddle Smart series. Consult

paddle craft safety, technique, and instruction.)


Chapter 14: Cold-Water Survival160
Self-Help
A person dumped into cold water should get out as
quickly as possible. If immersion occurs very close to
safety, such as a shoreline, then the person should swim
the short distance to get out of the water, even if that
means abandoning a capsized boat and gear. However, if
the distance is more than a few yards, the person should
either get out of the water as much as possible on a
capsized boat or assume the H.E.L.P. or huddle positions
until help arrives. Help should never be far away on a
properly planned float trip.
Swimming will generate heat through exercise, but the
increased water flow caused by swimming will rap-
idly conduct that heat away. Even a good swimmer will
not be able to swim very far in cold water. Also, heat
loss is concentrated at the head. Therefore, floating
techniques with the head in the water should not be used
in cold water; e.g., facedown survival floating or floating
on the back. A person’s ability to sustain themselves in
cold water improves greatly if he or she is wearing a life
jacket before immersion.

Boating Terminology
Like other specialties, boating has a special language. Familiarity with basic
terms is needed for good communication. Fore is toward the front or the bow; aft is
toward the back or the stern. Starboard is the boat’s right; port is the boat’s left.
The beam is the maximum width of the boat, and to move abeam is to go sideways.

Chapter 15: Boating Basics162
The gunwale, pronounced gunnel, is the top of the side in
an open boat, or where the deck connects the side in a
closed boat. A cockpit is an opening in a decked boat. A
transom is the piece across a flat stern. A keel is a strength
member running fore and aft along the center of the bottom
that is often missing in molded boats. A chine is a seam
or distinct change between the side and the bottom. The
bilge is the curvature between side and bottom when the
two are not distinct. Bilge can also indicate the deepest
depth on the inside of the hull, which is the part of the boat
that forms the sides and bottom. Chines, freeboard, rocker,
sheer, length overall (LOA), load waterline length (LWL),
and beam are all design elements that influence how the
boat performs its function.
Hull Forms
At low speeds, all boats displace water, or push it aside
as they move through it. As speed increases, some boats
are designed to remain displacement hulls. Other boats
are designed to plane, or skim along the surface of the
water once the speed reaches a certain point.
Displacement hulls become faster as beam decreases
and length increases. A touring canoe is a good example
of a well-designed displacement hull. However, length
affects turning ability, so whitewater canoe designs
sacrifice speed and tracking in favor of maneuverability by
shortening the hull and adding rocker.
Basic Parts
Dimensions
Displacement hull
Planing hull


Chapter 15: Boating Basics 163
Planing hulls tend to be flat, although many will have
a shallow V shape to improve directional stability.
Flat-bottomed boats tend to pound in rough water and
skid around turns. Simple planing hulls often have a hard
chine between the sides and bottom that is above the
waterline at the bow and curves down to the corners
of a flat transom. Stepped-chine boats have multiple
planing surfaces to allow rapid acceleration, but don’t
handle rough water as well as a single-chine form. Rough
water characteristics are improved by using inverted
V forms at the bow grading to a flatter hull at the stern.
Small planing sailboats and surfing kayaks tend to have
simple hull forms, whereas a multitude of hull designs are
used for small powerboats.
Boat Stability
The shape of the hull also affects stability, which is an
important safety consideration for small boats. Stability
reflects how well a boat resists a tipping force. A boat
is not very stable if a small load shift or a swell causes
the boat to capsize. Stability is measured by the restoring
force as a function of tilt angle, that is, how hard the boat
pushes back if you push down on the side. A round log has
no force to counter rotation. A racing shell has very little.
A properly loaded canoe has a surprisingly large amount,
and a wide, flat-bottomed johnboat has even more.
Although the width, freeboard, and cross-section shape
of a hull all influence the stability of an empty boat, load
distribution is the primary factor in how likely a boat is to
capsize in various conditions. Two large adults, plus gear,
in a 70-pound canoe can easily shift the boat’s balance
from stable to unstable.
A canoe is most stable when the paddlers are kneeling.
Occasionally, it is useful to stand in a canoe in calm water
to scout ahead, but standing needs to be done carefully.
Two people standing is a recipe for trouble.
Overloading contributes to boating fatalities. Don’t
exceed the manufacturer’s recommended load as
found on the boat’s capacity plate.


Chapter 15: Boating Basics164
Technical Aside: Primary and Secondary Stability
Many canoeing and kayaking
books contend that certain hull
shapes have poor “primary”
stability but good “second-
ary” stability. Similar observa-
tions are applied to sailboats
and other craft. To understand
the concept, a basic review
of forces is needed. Gravity,
acting through the center of
mass of the boat, gear, and
crew, pulls the boat down.
Displacement, acting through
the boat’s center of buoyancy,
pushes the boat up. The boat is
in equilibrium when the forces
of gravity and buoyancy are
balanced and directly opposed
to one another. If the boat is
tilted from its equilibrium position, the boat is stable if the center of buoyancy shifts outboard of the center of mass,
and unstable if the center of gravity shifts outboard of the center of buoyancy, as shown in the figures.
The size of the force acting to right a heeling boat depends on the separation of the center of mass and center of
buoyancy as a function of angle. The graph shows hypothetical curves for two flat-bottomed boats, one wide with
low freeboard, the other narrow with high freeboard. The first boat has a large righting moment at low angles of
heel. Such a boat has good initial or primary stability and is stiff, that is, difficult to heel initially. However, due to
the low freeboard, it can only be leaned half as far as the other boat before capsizing. The second boat has less
righting moment at low angles. Such boats are tender and will tend to roll in waves or as cargo is shifted. However,
the righting moment grows large at larger angles of heel. Such a boat is said to have good secondary stability. It
takes a larger outside force to capsize this boat than the other, even though the first boat feels less “tippy.” Note that
good secondary stability does not necessarily mean that a boat is designed to be operated with a heel, as the canoe
in the second illustration above or most sailboats. If the forces on a boat are realigned to establish equilibrium at
a heel, then the righting curves in the graph would need to
be recalculated.
A boat’s seaworthiness depends not only on resistance to
heeling forces but also on pitch and yaw characteristics;
that is, how the boat reacts to longitudinal and turning
forces. General hull traits, such as width, freeboard, and
cross-section shape, indicate seaworthiness but aren’t
completely reliable. Also, ultimate stability for small boats
often depends as much on load distribution, or trim, as on
hull shape.

Chapter 15: Boating Basics 165
Rules of the Road
Everyone operating a boat has the responsibility to avoid
collisions with other craft. Therefore, the craft should
always be under control, at a prudent speed, with a
constant lookout.
Rules establish which boat has the “right of way” in
various situations. However, not all recreational boat-
ers understand or follow the rules, so each skipper is
responsible for taking evasive actions if the other boat
doesn’t respond according to the rules. The following
illustrations cover common situations in recreational
boating. More-maneuverable boats should give way to
less-maneuverable boats. Because the ability of
sailboats to maneuver depends on the wind direction,
rules for sailboat-to-sailboat interactions are more
complicated. Specific requirements may vary from state
to state but generally follow the rules for federal water-
ways. The complete rules, which differ somewhat
between inland and international waters, may be obtained

Small recreational boats should yield right-of-way and
stay clear of large commercial vessels, particularly
fishing boats with nets deployed or strings of barges.
All boats must proceed at low speed in the vicinity of
military vessels and must not approach closer than 100
yards without permission.
Boats under power
should yield right-
of-way to wind- or
human-powered
craft; e.g., sailboats,
canoes, and kayaks. Powerboats meeting head-on each veer to the right
(starboard) so that they pass left side–to–left side
(port-to-port)—the same as cars meeting on an
unmarked gravel road.
When powerboats
are crossing, the
boat to starboard
has the right-of-
way. That is, yield
to a boat on your
right, but proceed
on course if the
other boat is on
your left.
Any boat overtaking another from behind should avoid
the slower boat ahead.

Signs, Markers, and Navigation Aids
Rivers, lakes, and coastlines often have marker buoys
deployed in the water to warn of danger, to mark chan-
nels through shallow water, and as general aids to
navigation. These are useful to sea kayakers as well
as powerboaters and sailors, and warn canoeists away
from dam structures and other dangers. The markers
should appear on area charts. Local authorities, canoe
liveries, and landowners may also post information
signs on the shore.
White can buoys or signs with orange, crossed
diamonds indicate areas prohibited to boaters.
White can buoys or signs with orange diamonds
indicate dangers.
White can buoys or signs with orange circles
indicate controlled areas.
Stay well clear of boats or floats with dive flags
indicating scuba divers or snorkelers in the water.
Be alert for informal signs on shore that provide
location checks or instructions.
The general rule for channel markers is red right
returning. When returning to shore, going upriver, or
traveling south on the Intracoastal Waterway, keep red,
even-numbered cones or triangular signs on your right,
and green, odd-numbered cans or square signs to your
left. Slow, shallow-draft boats should stay at the edges
of the channel to allow passage of larger craft. Even
shallow-draft boats such as kayaks may need to stay
within the channel markers to avoid damage to and from
coral reefs, to avoid sandbars at low tide, and to stay
clear of weeds and breakwaters.


Chapter 15: Boating Basics 167
Boats and the Law
Legal requirements for boats and boaters arise from
various jurisdictions, including federal, state, and local.
Enforcement agencies include the U.S. Coast Guard,
the Army Corps of Engineers, and park services. Safety
Afloat requires you to know and follow all regulatory
requirements. Check with local authorities to verify and
complete the material given here. The website of the
National Association of State Boating Law Adminis-
trators, www.nasbla.org, has links to state agencies
responsible for boating laws.
Registrations
Motorized craft must be registered in the state of principal
use. Requirements include display of numbers and vali-
dation stickers and onboard possession of a certificate of
number whenever the boat is in use. Some states require
registration and fees for all boats, including canoes,
kayaks, and inflatable rafts. In a few states, registration
fees may be waived for boats registered to not-for-profit
groups such as BSA councils and chartered units. Your
certificate of registration will include your boat number
and how it must be displayed. Normally, plain block let-
ters and numbers not less than 3 inches in height must be
affixed to the forward part of the vessel as shown.
Accident Reporting
Boat operators are required to promptly report to local
authorities any serious boating accident involving loss of
life, medical treatment beyond basic first aid, or property
damage exceeding $2,000. Incidents occurring during a
Scouting function must also be reported to the local council.
Operator License
Some states require boat operators to be older than a mini-
mum age and to possess a valid operator’s license. Gen-
erally these requirements apply only to motorized vessels,
but check with your state department of transportation or
other appropriate agency. In many cases, an operator per-
mit may be obtained by completing an online course.
Use Permits
Some lakes and rivers require boaters to obtain permits
prior to use. Permit acquisition may be as simple as pay-
ing a fee on the spot to use a launching area, or as com-
plicated as submitting an application to a national lottery
a year or more in advance of a trip. Permits may specify
numbers in the party, allowed campsites, and restrictions
on fires and waste disposal.
Signaling Equipment
Following sections will expand on the type of equipment
needed for a safe, enjoyable trip in various types of craft.
However, all craft under federal jurisdiction are required
to carry an audible device, such as a whistle, that can
be used to signal other boats. For canoes, kayaks, and
other small boats, it’s a good idea for everyone to have
a whistle attached to their life jacket during a float trip,
even if it is not a local requirement.

Canoeing Skills
Canoeing Activities
Canoeing is popular with Boy Scout and Venturing groups. Scout groups delight in canoe trips, whether for a day or a
week, far away in the Canadian wilderness or on a local lake, or down a distant river or on a local stream. The material
in this section is tailored to the cruising canoeist, but modern canoeing takes many forms, from dragon boats with large
crews, to solo whitewater slalom racers, to freestyle “ballets” set to music. Specialized canoeing has led to a variety of
canoe types and paddling techniques. There is no single best boat or universal perfect stroke.
Chapter
16


Chapter 16: Canoeing Skills170
General-purpose canoes of aluminum or composite mate-
rials are good for flat-water day-tripping or just messing
around. Avoid hull materials that flex when moving through
the water. Longer boats float higher, slide easily through
the water, and track well. High-volume boats are good
for carrying lots of gear on an extended trip. Lightweight
boats are good when you need to carry the canoe across
portages. Boats with little sheer and low sides offer less
wind resistance; boats with raised ends take waves better.
Marathon and sprint racers use long, narrow, lightweight
boats, often with asymmetric hulls. These specialized
boats are seldom appropriate for Scout trips, but some of
the stroke techniques can be adapted for cruising.
Downriver canoes designed for cruising in flowing water
are shorter than their flat-water counterparts and have
more rocker. They are a bit more sluggish and don’t track
as well, but they are more responsive and turn easier.
They often are made of materials capable of regaining
their shape after impact. Open boats, properly handled,
are suitable for carrying gear through minor white water.
“Playboats” with flotation bags, pedestal seats, and thigh
straps are used in heavy white water.
Whitewater competitors use decked boats resembl-
ing kayaks.
Learning to Paddle
First, learn to swim. BSA policies restrict canoeing
instruction to those who complete the standardized 100-
yard swimmer test. Second, seek out an experienced
instructor. Canoeing is a physical skill, somewhere in
difficulty between kayaking and ice skating. It is possible
to learn through individual study and practice, but it’s
much easier with someone to guide the way. The basics
can be learned in a few hours, but mastery takes concen-
tration and practice. Don’t get discouraged if the canoe
doesn’t always react as you expect. Go slow and easy
until “canoe sense” becomes engrained.
With an accomplished paddler coaching from the stern, it
is possible to learn while doing—during a flat-water trip,
for example. However, it is generally better to pick up the
basics in a class setting before hitting the water. Trying to
learn on a trip when the wind picks up and your partner
isn’t as skilled, or patient, as he or she should be, can be a
disheartening experience. Keep canoeing fun by learning
and teaching it in a proper setting.
Safety Afloat requires Scouts to have three hours of train-
ing or to demonstrate proficiency before paddling on a
float trip. The ability to perform the basic skills covered in
this chapter constitutes appropriate training. Adults and
Venturers may learn the skills by completing BSA Paddle
Craft Safety training. Scouts who earn the Canoeing merit
badge cover these skills and more. Quickstart Your Canoe
and Introduction to Canoe by the American Canoe Asso-
ciation are also good introductory training programs.
Your instructor should choose an appropriate setting and
tailor the lessons to conditions. Ideally, there should be
no current until you are ready to master river skills. If a
sheltered cove without wind or waves cannot be found,
then the lesson may need to be postponed until weather
conditions improve.


Chapter 16: Canoeing Skills 171
Your instructor should also provide or help you choose
equipment appropriate for a novice. A long, stable boat
that tracks well is preferable to a slender, tippy racer or a
short whitewater boat with lots of rocker. Even those who
can make a 17-foot cruising canoe respond to their every
whim may find their first experience in a short, whitewater
solo playboat to be like paddling an inner tube.
Choosing a Paddle
Canoes, paddlers, and paddles come in different sizes, and
much is written about how to match one with the others.
When you are positioned for paddling in the canoe, hold-
ing the paddle vertically at your side, the upper end of the
blade, or throat, should be just underwater; the end of
the grip, depending on who you ask, should be even with
your shoulder, chin, nose, or eyes. Those few inches of
leeway are a matter of preference or paddling style and
shouldn’t affect your ability to learn. That is fortunate since
the paddles at many Scout camps come in 6-inch incre-
ments. Although scoffed at by some, a useful rule is that
the grip of a paddle placed on the ground should come up
around your chin, nose, or eyes. If the paddle is only mid-
way up your chest, or over your head, it probably is either
too short or too long. If you find two paddles, one at eye
level and one just below your chin, take them both to the
canoe and test them in the water. It’s probably best not to
buy an expensive paddle at a custom length until you have
perfected your own paddling style in your own canoe.
Paddles angled at the throat may appear broken, but are
deliberately built with angles of roughly 12 to 15 degrees
and are used with the blade angled forward. Many mara-
thon racers contend that bent-shaft paddles provide bet-
ter stroke efficiency and will argue that results prove their
advantage. On the other hand, Olympic sprint racers are
allowed to use bent-shaft paddles but don’t. Since some
flat-water strokes are better done with a straight shaft,
and straight shafts are generally preferred for white water,
it is probably best for a novice to begin with a straight
shaft. Some paddles have multiple bends in the shaft for
a more comfortable grip, but those aren’t widely available
for instruction.
Paddles are made of different materials and have dif-
ferent-style grips, shafts, and blades. When you’re just
starting out, any of the common grips will be appropri-
ate. Avoid excessively narrow or wide blades. Ideally, the
shape of the shaft at the throat should be an oval, wider
front-to-back to fit your hand. A circular cross section
is fine, but avoid paddles that have the grip excessively
wide from side to side. Also avoid the inexpensive, heavy,
all-plastic paddles that flex during a stroke. Those are not
recommended for Scout use.

Launching the Canoe
1. Use a perpendicular launch, either bow first or stern
first, when the water is shallow, access is limited,
or in waves. Carry the boat to the shoreline, place
the paddles aboard, then lift from the center. Slide
the canoe hand-over-hand into the water until it is
floating free.
2. The paddler who will be at the end facing the shore
steadies the canoe while squatting. The other
paddler steps in the center of the canoe and moves
into position by walking along the centerline while
bending to grasp the gunwales.
3. The first person in the boat kneels in position and
steadies the canoe with the paddle braced in the
water. The second person then enters along the
centerline. If the water is shallow, the second
person may need to go past their paddling position to
the middle of the canoe to allow the shoreward end to
float free. They assume their paddling position after
the other paddler moves the boat slightly offshore.
To avoid damage to the hull, don’t enter a canoe that is
bridged, that is, has one end in the water, one end on
shore, and an air gap between. You may need to wade
into the water to ensure that the canoe floats freely
before and after you enter.
Use a parallel launch from a dock, at a wide beach with
deep water, or into a current. Place the boat in the water
broadside to the shore and load your gear. One person
steadies the boat while the other gets into position by
stepping carefully onto the centerline of the boat. The first
person in the boat then steadies the boat while the second
person gets into position. In a current, carefully consider
which direction to point the boat, and who enters first.
Safety Tip:
When moving around in a canoe, always maintain
three points of contact: two feet and one hand, for
example; or two hands and one foot, as shown in
these illustrations.


Chapter 16: Canoeing Skills 173
Paddling Positions
Tandem paddlers paddle on opposite sides from posi-
tions near the bow and stern. The boat should be trimmed
roughly level fore and aft. Adjust the trim by moving gear
and paddlers.
Kneeling in the center of the canoe, with knees apart and
braced against thigh straps, provides the best stability and
allows a quick shift of the paddle to the other side.
Kneeling vertically, but slightly toward the paddling side, helps
with stroke execution. Weight should be against a thwart or
seat edge, not on the knees. Pads help make kneeling comfort-
able even for long trips.
The knee opposite the paddle may be raised with the leg
extended forward as an alternate relief position to kneeling
with both legs.
A well-designed canoe will have seats positioned to provide
comfort along with reasonable stability. In some designs, your
feet may be tucked under the seat. In other designs, that might
be awkward or risk entanglement.
One or both legs may also be extended forward from a seated posi-
tion. Marathon racers sometime brace their feet against blocks.
Avoid sitting with lifted knees that interfere with your paddling.


Chapter 16: Canoeing Skills174
Forward Stroke Overview
The forward stroke provides basic propulsion in all types
of canoeing. It is simple in concept, although details vary
from one canoeist to another. In all cases, the stroke can be
divided into three phases: the catch phase (putting the blade
into the water), the power phase (accelerating the canoe
If you keep your back straight and your shoulders square,
it is possible to do a forward stroke by bending your arms.
However, it is more practical to use your back and shoul-
der muscles. Kayakers rely almost completely on torso
rotation to generate power. They rotate their shoulders
first forward, then back. At the other extreme, rowers in
forward), and the recovery phase (removing the paddle from
the water and returning to the catch position). The upper
drawings illustrate the catch and power phases for a seated
marathon racer on the left, a kneeling cruiser in the middle,
and a sprint racer in a high kneeling position on the right. The
bottom drawings show the recovery phase.
whitewater rafts “put their backs into it” by leaning both
shoulders forward and then back. Some authors suggest
that canoeists should mimic kayakers. However, videos
of flat-water and whitewater racing canoeists reveal
various combinations of both rotation and lean. A
cruising canoeist need not exaggerate either.


Chapter 16: Canoeing Skills 175
Forward Stroke Components
When describing strokes, it is useful to use the term
onside to refer to the side of the boat the paddle is on.
Offside is the opposite.
Just before the catch, the paddle blade is in the air over
the water toward the bow. The hand on the shaft loosely
grasps the paddle just above the throat with your hands a
bit more than shoulder width apart. Your grip hand is just
above eye level, slightly aft of the shaft hand and ideally
over the onside gunwale. You may lean slightly forward,
but there is no need to stretch or rotate uncomfortably.
You start the forward stroke by knifing the blade into the
water by driving both hands down. Don’t slap the water
using only your lower arm.
During the catch, firmly grasp the paddle, but no tighter
than needed. Pull back with your lower arm comfortably
straight. Looking from the front, the shaft should remain
vertical throughout the power phase. Pull straight back
parallel with the boat’s centerline rather than following
the gunwale. Your grip hand will move just a bit forward
and then back during the power phase. Ideally, the pad-
dle should also be close to vertical when viewed from the
side, at least as it approaches your hip. To transfer power
from the paddle to the canoe, it is necessary to move
the paddle backward more rapidly than the canoe is
moving forward. However, think of the stroke as planting
the blade in the water and pulling the canoe toward it.
To maintain your cruising speed, you only need to apply
enough power to restore the momentum lost to friction
and wind since your last stroke. That is easily, and most
effectively, done in the short distance from the catch to
or just past your hip. The power phase, either cruising or
racing, is relatively short and ends once the paddle has
stopped accelerating. The recovery begins in the water
as you seek some way to remove the paddle without
creating drag or other adverse affects.
Some folks let the paddle blade continue to arc upward
past their hip. So long as the paddle is moving at constant
speed, not jerked upward, that approach is reasonable
and provides a relaxed stroke rate with time for course
correction. Those in more of a hurry may slice the blade
sideways out of the water or bend their lower arm to lift
the paddle vertically. Still others rotate the grip to make
the blade parallel with the canoe and slice upward. If you
don’t overanalyze the situation, your natural tendencies
will probably serve you well. When cruising, return the
blade to the catch position by turning, or feathering, it
sideways to avoid catching wind or waves.

Paddling in a Straight Line
Paddling in a straight line is one of the more difficult tasks
in flat-water canoeing, but it is really not that difficult if
you are paddling with a savvy partner. Paddle on oppo-
site sides, at the same time, and you are most of the way
there. However, even though each paddler pulls paral-
lel to the centerline, the offset from the centerline to the
gunwale generates a slight sideways force, or torque. In
most canoes, the stern paddler is farther from the boat’s
pivot point than the bow paddler, and the mismatch of
forces eventually causes the boat to turn away from the
stern paddler’s side. To compensate, the bow paddler
can pull harder or the stern paddler less forcefully. The
stern paddler might even skip a stroke or use the paddle
as a rudder. If the wind is blowing from the side, the stern
paddler can paddle on the side opposite the wind. Any of
those methods will work if you have patience and aren’t
battling a gusty headwind or a current. If you’re in a hurry
or a jam, you can always switch sides every few strokes.
Marathon racers routinely switch sides to relieve muscle
fatigue, and their boats track well. However, novices try-
ing the hit-and-switch technique tend to zigzag or snake
through the water. It’s worth the effort to learn other
techniques for maintaining a straight course. Tandem
and solo sprint racers make a beeline over a kilometer or
more, and anyone taking the time to switch sides during
those races would lose.
Stern Correction Stroke
The stern paddler can always pull the bow toward their
paddling side by adding a hook, pry, or reverse sweep at the
end of a forward stroke. Whitewater paddlers make those
combinations to forcibly turn the bow in the direction they
desire. However, those techniques are more powerful
than needed by a flat-water cruiser, tend to make the boat
zigzag, and kill forward momentum. Only a slight modifica-
tion to a cruising forward stroke is normally needed to make
the necessary course correction.
The stern paddler wishing to compensate for the tendency
to veer off course simply rotates the paddle during the com-
pletion of a forward power stroke by turning the thumb of
the grip hand downward. The rotation begins as the blade
nears the hip. Once the blade is parallel to the centerline,
it is pulled past the hip and then lifted from the water. The
amount of correction can be adjusted by when the rotation
is started, by varying the angle the paddle is rotated, and
by moving the grip hand slightly outboard of the shaft hand.
The proper name for this stroke is the pitch stroke. If a turn
is needed rather than a simple correction, the blade can be
pushed outward at the end of the stroke. That makes the
pitch stroke more akin to the classic J stroke.
There are numerous variations to the stroke just described.
Any technique that lets you track straight without killing
forward momentum accomplishes the task.
When you are first perfecting your stern steering stroke,
concentrate on the motion of the blade rather than the
direction the canoe is heading. Proceed slowly and stop
just before the recovery to make sure your grip thumb is
pointing down, the shaft is parallel to the canoe, and the
blade is aligned fore and aft.
Once you think you have the idea, then work to keep the
canoe on course. To check your mastery, try the stroke
solo. Have the bow paddler turn to face aft while you
demonstrate and explain the stroke.
If you try the stroke solo from a stop, you may need to
take a few strokes starting with a short diagonal draw
until you gain momentum. It also helps to learn in a boat
that tracks well.
Each paddler generates a rotational force, or
torque, like a person sitting on a swivel chair
pushing with a ski pole on one side.
Torque depends on the distance from the center of rotation.
The stern paddler typically generates more, like the person
at the end of the seesaw, and the canoe veers off course.


Chapter 16: Canoeing Skills 177
Draw and Pry
The draw stroke pulls the canoe toward your paddling side.
Rotate your shoulders to face the onside gunwale, reach
out with both arms, and plant the paddle in the water with
the shaft vertical, one hand above the other, and the blade
facing you. Then draw the canoe to the paddle.
If you need to make another draw, recover in the water by
turning the blade perpendicular to the canoe and sliding it
back out as you rotate to face the side. The thumb on your
grip hand will point out.
Although both arms will be extended over the water, keep
your body over the canoe to maintain stability.
The pry pushes the canoe
away from your paddling
side. Rotate as you would
for a draw stroke, but place
the paddle against the side
of the canoe with the shaft
vertical when viewed from
the side. Your shaft hand
should be just above the
gunwale. Your grip hand should be slightly outboard. Use
the boat as a fulcrum to lever the canoe sideways as you
pull back with your grip hand. The stroke should be short
and powerful—don’t pull in past the center. If you need
another pry, feather the blade in the water and slice it
back into position.
If the canoe has straight or flared sides, the paddle will
pivot on the gunwale. The contact may be further down
on a boat with tumblehome (inward curve of the side
above the waterline).


Chapter 16: Canoeing Skills178
Communication Tip: Tandem paddlers operate as a
team. For long straight passages on flat water, the bow
paddler provides power while the stern paddler makes
minor course corrections, but both paddlers must work
together when major course changes are needed. Clear
instructions are essential, particularly if the course
change must be done quickly. “Port” and “starboard,”
as well as “onside” and “offside,” have their uses, but
it’s hard to beat “right” and “left” to indicate direction.
Canoeists almost always face forward. At other times,
it may be useful to call out the name of a stroke. Either
paddler may initiate action as required and should be
able to rely on the other to respond appropriately.
Moving Sideways
Draws and pries are used in opposition to move the canoe
sideways (abeam). Various combinations are shown
below. Moving sideways may be useful from a stationary
position, such as pulling away from a dock or assisting a
person in distress; or while moving, for instance to avoid
a submerged stump.
Sweeps
During a sweep, the paddle moves in an arc, or part of a
circle. Forward sweeps with the paddle moving aft turn the
canoe away from the paddling side. Reverse sweeps with
the paddle moving forward turn the canoe toward the pad-
dling side. In tandem canoeing, sweeps are quarter circles
between the ends of the canoe and the side of the paddler.
A person in the bow begins a forward quarter sweep by
rotating the onside shoulder toward the bow. The grip hand
is kept low, and the shaft hand slides away from the throat
as the blade is laid along the bow perpendicular to the water.
The blade is pulled away from the canoe as the torso is
rotated to face forward. The blade is kept submerged
near the surface. The power phase ends when the shaft
becomes perpendicular to the centerline.
To recover, the blade is feathered flat over the water and
arced back to the bow.
A forward quarter sweep in the stern position begins
perpendicular to the canoe and arcs to the rear.
Desired travel direction
Desired travel direction


Chapter 16: Canoeing Skills 179
A reverse quarter sweep in the stern position begins at
the stern and arcs forward until the shaft is perpendicular
to the canoe.
A reverse quarter sweep in the bow position begins with the
shaft perpendicular to the canoe and arcs toward the bow.
Turns and Pivots
Forward sweeps are used for gradual turns while under
way. To turn away from the bow paddler’s side, the bow
paddler sweeps. To make the turn sharper, the stern
paddler can add a pry at the end of a forward stroke.
To turn the other direction, the stern paddler sweeps.
The bow paddler can assist in making a sharper turn by
adding a draw at the beginning of a forward stroke.
Pivots are handy when you’ve been exploring a narrow cove
and need to turn around. Pivots are circular turns within the
boat’s own length made around the boat’s center. They may
be done in one direction with both paddlers doing a draw,
or in the other direction with both paddlers doing a pry.
However, the use of quarter sweeps is more efficient since
the paddles are farther toward the ends of the canoe.
Counterclockwise pivot
To turn away from the bow paddler’s side (offside), the
bow paddler does a forward quarter sweep while the
stern paddler does a reverse quarter sweep. Reverse the
strokes to turn in the opposite direction.

Stopping and Moving Backward
To stop a canoe, “hold water” with the blade vertical in
the water at the end of a stroke.
To hasten the stop, or to move backward, stroke in
reverse. Rotate your shoulders aft, place the blade in the
water near your hips, and push the blade forward. When
you can no longer keep the paddle reasonably vertical,
feather it back to the starting point and repeat the stroke.
Quickly stopping a canoe that is traveling fast takes a
large force to hold the paddle in place. It helps to hold
the shaft against the side of the boat, but be careful about
using your thumb to hold the paddle in place.
Landing
Land a canoe by reversing the steps you took to launch it.
For a perpendicular landing, stop the canoe before it hits
the bank rather than running it aground.
Rescue of a
Distressed Swimmer
A canoe may be used as a rescue craft at a unit swim. Units
on float trips may also be in a position to rescue swimmers
or boaters without a life jacket who have been separated
from their craft. Approach a distressed swimmer from sta-
ble paddling positions—kneeling, if possible. If you have
an extra flotation device aboard, throw it to the swimmer
as you approach bow first. After the subject has grasped
the aid, or if there is no aid available, the bow paddler
reaches out with a paddle. Once the subject grabs hold,
the bow paddler swings the subject and bow together to
allow the subject to grasp the end of the canoe. The bow
paddler should give clear instructions throughout.
Swamped Boat Drill
Most canoeists inadvertently swamp a boat now and
then. An intentional capsize helps prepare the boater for
such an accident. To safely capsize a canoe, both pad-
dlers should sit on the bottom of the boat facing the same
side with their legs over the gunwale. One hand is placed
on each gunwale. The partners then move their weight
over the bilge and, if necessary, gently rock from side to


Chapter 16: Canoeing Skills 181
side until water comes in over the gunwale and fills the
boat. The boat should settle in the water rather than flip.
Canoes will float even when filled with water. Capsized
canoeists should remain with the boat, which is more
easily spotted by rescuers than are swimmers. If near the
shore, the swamped canoeists may swim the boat ashore
or paddle it with their hands while sitting upright on the
bottom. Their buddy boat should be nearby at all times.
Canoe-Over-Canoe Recovery
If the water is calm, the shore fairly distant, and the canoes
not very loaded, then the buddy boat may elect to perform a
canoe-over-canoe rescue, provided the swamped canoeists
are not injured or in danger of hypothermia. If the swamped
canoeists are in distress, then they should either be brought
aboard the rescue craft or be towed immediately to shore
unless the rescuers are proficient enough to retrieve their
boat quickly. If the swamped boat is fully loaded with gear, it
may be more practical for the rescue boat to tow it ashore.
Come alongside the capsized canoe while instructing the
people in the water to move first to the ends of their boat
and then to the ends of your boat on the far side.
Either transfer their gear to your boat or let it float free for
later retrieval.
The bow paddler turns to face the stern and may need to
move toward the center. Swing the capsized canoe at a
right angle to yours. As you raise the end, turn the canoe
bottom up and rest the end on your gunwale.
Ease the swamped canoe across the gunwales of your
canoe, scooting it along until it is balanced.
Roll the capsized canoe upright across your canoe and
then slide it back onto the water on the same side you
brought it from.
Hold the emptied canoe alongside yours and stabilize it
as its crew climbs back aboard one at a time. Allowing
the gunwale near your boat to lift slightly will make it eas-
ier for them to board.


Chapter 16: Canoeing Skills182
Deepwater Entry
If you fall overboard without swamping your canoe, or
need to reenter a canoe after a canoe-over-canoe recov-
ery, then the following technique will be useful. Your part-
ner or buddy boat can help by steadying the canoe with
the gunwale down on the side you are entering.
1
Enter from the middle where the gunwale is lowest; push
down on the gunwale with both hands to bring your hips
above the water. A strong kick may help. Your partner
needs to provide counterbalance.
2
As your hips come up, lean forward to grasp the opposite
gunwale or along a thwart.
3
Rotate your hips to sit inside the canoe with your legs
over the gunwale. Then bring your feet aboard. Move to
a paddling position to steady the boat if your buddy still
needs to enter.
Other procedures for deep water entry are shown in the
Canoeing merit badge pamphlet.
Some people prefer the heel hook method.
An easy method if a short line or strap is available is to
use a loop as a stirrup.


Chapter 16: Canoeing Skills 183
Technical Aside: Power to the Paddle
Books on canoeing often note that the canoe is pulled to the paddle rather than the paddle moved through the water.
When the canoe is moving at a reasonable pace, the paddle is almost stationary in the water, but not quite. You move the
canoe forward by accelerating water backward. Canoes, kayaks, swimmers, and powerboats all respond according to
Newton’s third law of motion: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If the paddle, hand, or propeller
didn’t slip at all, water would not be moved backward (the action), and there would be no momentum imparted to the
canoe through the paddle (the reaction).
Consider moving a large, heavily loaded canoe from a stop using a paddle. On your first stroke, you will accelerate a
mass of water backward, and the boat will respond by accelerating forward. The force on the water (mass × acceleration
according to Newton’s second law) imparts an opposite force of the same magnitude on the boat. However, because the
boat is massive (heavy), it will accelerate only a little compared to the water moved by the paddle. During the stroke, the
paddle may move backward more than the canoe moves forward.
Although a single stroke won’t make the canoe move very fast, it is efficient. Some of the energy is lost to friction—that
is, pushing water aside—but most of it imparts momentum to the canoe. Were it not for friction, the boat would continue
gliding slowly all the way across the lake (Newton’s first law). You can minimize energy loss to friction by letting the
boat glide to a stop between every stroke, but your pace will be slow. Instead, take a few powerful strokes to reach
the cruising speed you would like, and then cut back on the power to balance propulsion against friction. Be aware
that friction increases rapidly with speed. Short, easy strokes at a uniform, relaxed pace will let you eat up the miles
without overexertion.
Now consider the following diagram of paddle motion of an Olympic sprinter moving past a fixed point.
As the blade is punched into the still water, the shaft of the paddle
continues to move forward at boat speed. If the paddler resisted
that motion by holding the shaft fixed to the boat, tremendous
drag would result—that’s how you stop.
If the paddler allows the shaft to move backward relative to their
body at the speed of the boat, little is accomplished. There is a
bit of drag, but no energy added to the boat. To add energy, the
paddler must pull back on the paddle to make it move backward
faster than the canoe is moving forward. That is, the still water
must be accelerated backward. To do that, the paddle must push
backward relative to a point fixed in the water. The end of the
blade rotates aft in the diagram, though not by much.
Once the water begins moving in response to the paddle, it must then be moved even faster to impart more energy. That
is, the water must be accelerated by an accelerating paddle. Moving the paddle backward at constant speed doesn’t
have much effect, either positive or negative. If you aren’t in a big hurry, it doesn’t really hurt to allow the paddle to
continue past your hip to the surface. You probably won’t win a race, but neither will you noticeably pull the boat down
into the water unless you jerk the blade upward. A slower recovery allows your muscles to rest between strokes and
allows time for a steering stroke.
The racer is only able to accelerate the paddle over a short distance. At this point, various physical and physiological
limits have been reached. All the paddler can do is add just enough energy to make up for the energy lost due to the
friction of the boat moving through the water. The boat continues toward the finish line at fairly constant speed. The
athlete is unable to move the paddle fast enough to make the boat go faster.
Note that the paddle blade changes angle, or rotates about a moving point, during the power phase. Ideally, the blade should
be held vertically at all times, but that is not the case. Fixing the blade at an angle to the shaft, as in a bent-shaft paddle,
would allow a more vertical angle at the end of the power phase, but it is not clear what impact that has on the entire
stroke or how the timing of the stroke should be modified to take advantage of the bend. The hydrodynamics are extremely
complicated. Rather than rely on an oversimplified analysis, be open to trying different paddle designs with various grips,
shaft lengths, blade shapes, and blade angles. Then enjoy paddling with whatever paddle strikes your fancy.

Portaging
Two people can efficiently carry a canoe from a rack or
a trailer a short distance to the water by grasping each
end. Other techniques are useful when longer distances
are involved, particularly when gear needs to be carried
at the same time. The following techniques can be used
to portage a canoe around a rapid or between lakes.


Kayaking Skills
Comparisons between canoes and kayaks are inevitable. Traditionally, a canoe was an open boat designed for
transporting goods and people, whereas the kayak was an enclosed single-person craft used for hunting. Canoeists
typically used a single-bladed paddle but occasionally adopted the double-bladed paddle usually used by the kayaker.
Those classic differences persist today; the casual observer may easily confuse an enclosed competitive whitewater
canoe with a kayak, except that one paddler will use a single blade and the other a double.
Chapter
17


Chapter 17: Kayaking Skills186
In recent years, kayaking has rivaled canoeing in popular-
ity. The reasons are many. An inexpensive kayak often costs
less than an inexpensive canoe, though high-end models
of either are pricey. A short, decked kayak in expert hands
can safely negotiate white water that would be impossible
for the most experienced team in a long, open canoe. That’s
one reason whitewater-canoe designs have adopted kayak
characteristics. On the other end of the design spectrum, a
double touring kayak may not have the capacity or ease of
portage of a touring canoe, but can carry sufficient supplies
for a long trek. However, ease of use may be the kayak’s
greatest appeal to the novice boater.
The difficulty of gaining reasonable proficiency as a solo
canoeist may be likened to that of learning to ride a bicycle.
The first attempts are likely wobbly and may be frustrating.
Practice and patience are needed before confidence is
achieved. A novice in a kayak, however, may quickly find that
the boat responds agreeably, somewhat akin to starting out
on a bicycle with training wheels. Imperfect analogies aside,
both the canoe and the kayak have their champions and both
will satisfy recreational needs into the future, whether those
needs are to connect with nature on a remote backwater, to
find thrills on a swiftly moving river, to compete with others
in endurance and skill, or simply to delight in the graceful
coordination of craft, body, and thought.
Kayak Designs
Kayaks come in a wide assortment of designs intended
for different paddling activities. For example, a flat-water
sprint racing kayak is designed for light weight and easy
tracking, whereas a whitewater slalom racer is short with
pronounced rocker for easy turning.
Originally, kayaks were made of sealskins stretched over
a wood and bone frame. The Inuit used them for hunting
and fishing. Early recreational kayaks were made of cloth
over wooden frames, and some modern folding kayak
designs still use fabric on a frame.
Typical recreational kayaks are designed for versatility.
They are of moderate length and have large cockpit open-
ings. They are great for learning and short trips on protected
waters. Most inexpensive models are made of molded
polyethylene plastic, which is durable but weighs more
than other construction materials. Some designs have
double cockpits for tandem paddlers.
Sit-on-top kayaks lack a cockpit and have seats and
foot braces molded into the deck. They often are made
of polyethylene and come in single and double versions.
They are great for short excursions in warm waters and
are good support craft for snorkeling. Expect a wet ride.
Specially designed sit-on-tops are used for surfing ocean
waves, which is not an activity for a novice.


Chapter 17: Kayaking Skills 187
Touring kayaks are larger and have dry storage capacity
for camping gear. They are long, often up to 17 feet for
single versions and close to 20 feet for tandem models.
Even though long lengths with little rocker help tracking,
many models are also equipped with a folding rudder.
Fiberglass or Kevlar composites are often used in
construction to reduce weight. Spray skirts help keep out
water. These boats are also known as sea kayaks due
to their use around ocean shorelines.
Whitewater kayaks typically have short hulls with
pronounced rocker. Creek boats, playboats, and
squirt boats have various design features such as
blunt ends, multiple chines, and planing hulls depending
on whether the goal is the first descent of a wild river or
performing cartwheels and spins in a rodeo competition.
Some designs have different tips to adapt a basic hull to
different specialties.


Chapter 17: Kayaking Skills188
Learning to Paddle
Kayaking BSA introduces
Boy Scouts, Venturers, and
leaders to basic flat-water
kayaking skills. Check with your
local council service center
for approved instructors or ask
the council aquatics committee
to initiate a local program. The
Kayaking merit badge teaches
Boy Scouts kayaking skills and
safety for calm water. Material
in the merit badge pamphlet
provides additional information
to that given here.
If your council does not have a kayaking program, check
with local paddling clubs for assistance. They may offer
basic and advanced kayak classes using instructors
affiliated with the American Canoe Association.
Paddles
The blades of kayak paddles come in various designs.
Large blades provide more power per stroke; smaller
blades take less energy per stroke. Many blades are
lightly cupped or spooned for increased water resistance
over a flat blade of the same projected area. The curve is
oriented to scoop water toward the stern. Some blades
are asymmetrical. That is, the shape of the blade above
the centerline of the shaft is different from that below.
The shape is designed to balance the area, and hence the
force, on the top and bottom of the blade when the paddle
shaft is inserted into the water at an angle.
Inflatable kayaks have flat-water and whitewater uses.
They can be deflated for easy transport and provide a fun
experience in many settings. A lack of rigidity can affect
performance, but inserts are used to improve stiffness.
Note: Some kayak designs come in different
sizes. You should fit snugly but comfortably in
a kayak with a cockpit.

Chapter 17: Kayaking Skills 189
Many paddles have the blades set at an angle to
one another from 30 to 60 degrees. The offset angle
automatically feathers the blade out of the water
when the blade in the water is perpendicular to the
boat’s centerline. Feathering reduces wind and splash
resistance. Touring paddles often come in two sections
that, when assembled, allow the feathering angle to
be varied.
A paddle with spooned, asymmetrical blades set at an
angle has top and bottom sides and right and left ends.
Depending on how the blade angles are set, paddles are
either right-hand or left-hand controlled. Most are
set in the right-hand control position. That is, the grip of
the right hand will not change during use. The wrist of the
right hand is rotated to set the proper blade angle on each
side of the boat. The shaft rotates freely in the left hand.
Quality paddles have an oval shaft, which provides better
control and comfort and helps you set the correct angle.
Most paddles have straight shafts, but a few designs are
bent at the grip positions to ease strain on the wrists.
Correct paddle length depends on the length of the
blades, on your dimensions, those of your boat, your
style of paddling, and your personal preference. Gener-
ally, whitewater paddlers use a slightly shorter paddle
than touring kayakers. Paddles are normally sized in
centimeters with typical lengths between 190 and 220
centimeters, or around 6½ to 7 feet. Don’t have a metric
ruler handy? Stand with the paddle upright with one blade
touching the ground. If the end of the top blade is less
than head high, the paddle is probably too short. If you
can’t reach the top of the blade with the fingertips of your
extended arm, the paddle is probably too long. Pick a size
or two in between, see how they feel in the water, and
check with your instructor.
Boarding
After checking on land that the kayak is a good fit, place
the kayak in ankle-deep water or at the edge of a low
bank or dock. Use your paddle for balance by placing one
end on the bank or bottom and the other end just behind
the cockpit coaming (rim). Sit on the deck, not the paddle,
and place one foot in the cockpit. Bring the other foot into
the cockpit, then slide your legs into the boat. Reverse the
process to exit. On sandy beaches, some people board
in a similar manner but with the bow of the kayak in the
water and the back resting on the ground.


Chapter 17: Kayaking Skills190
Capsize Drill
Kayaks are sufficiently stable that an unintentional
capsize in calm water should be a rare event rather than
a foregone conclusion. Even so, a capsize drill early in
the learning process is a useful safety exercise to remove
any apprehension about an accidental capsize during
stroke practice.
A capsize drill for a sit-on-top or inflatable kayak is
simple: lean over, slide off, right the boat if necessary,
and climb back on board. A capsize drill for a decked
kayak is only a bit more complicated. After you roll over,
if you don’t automatically fall clear of the boat, do the
following: Lean forward and grasp the coaming behind
your back. Straighten your legs and push the kayak
forward with your hands as you slide your feet out.
You should fall out of the cockpit in a somersault. Try to
maintain contact with the kayak as you bring your head
above water to one side. Master this technique in a pool
or calm water before you need it. Make sure the water
is free of obstacles and deep enough that you don’t hit
the bottom when you roll over. Both your buddy and your
instructor should be watching.
Balance
Kayakers “wear” their boats in the sense that power is
transferred from the paddle to the boat through the torso,
hips, and legs. Turns, braces, and rolls involve the hips as
well as the paddle. You can experiment with hip action
as part of the capsize drill. Try to tilt the kayak to the side
using your hips, not your paddle. Keep your upper body
upright so that your center of mass stays over the center
of the boat. With practice you should be able to lean the
boat almost 45 degrees to each side by cocking your hips.
Flick the boat level again simply by moving your hips back
to normal. When you are ready to practice capsizing, lean
the boat not with your hips but by rolling your whole body
to the side.


Chapter 17: Kayaking Skills 191
Opening Exercises
Do the following, either on land or on the water, or both, to
prepare for paddling the first time. Space your hands by
holding the paddle above your head horizontally with your
elbows at 90-degree angles. Then hold the paddle level
in front of you. The knuckles of your control hand should
be aligned with the edge of the blade nearest that hand.
If you are using a right-hand control paddle and you are
grasping the shaft with your wrists flat, then the blade on
the right will be tilted slightly forward. Hold the shaft firmly
with your control hand and rotate the paddle by bending
your wrist down and rolling your knuckles back. Let the
shaft rotate freely in your other hand. Practice rotating the
blades a quarter turn by flexing your wrist up and down.
This exercise prepares you to angle the blade correctly on
both sides of the kayak.
Next, with the paddle still level, push one blade forward
and pull the other back by twisting your torso. Keep your
elbows loose but don’t change their angles. A few swings
back and forth should loosen your muscles sufficiently
that you are able to comfortably point first one and then
the other blade forward. This exercise prepares you to
derive power from torso rotation rather than your arms.


Chapter 17: Kayaking Skills192
Forward Sweep
Forward strokes are done with the blade close to the boat
pushing the water to the rear; turning strokes are most
efficient with the blade moved away from the boat in a
half-circle. The circle for the sweep begins at the bow and
turns the boat away from the paddling side. Your elbow,
hand, and paddle blade will be lower on the opposite side
than they are for the forward stroke. Power still comes
from torso rotation. Recovery is done by feathering the
power blade just above the surface. Several sweeps from
one side from a stop will spin, or pivot, the boat. A sweep
while under way will change the boat’s direction, and can
be adjusted to control the amount of the turn. A sweep on
the other side will turn the boat in the opposite direction.
The Forward Stroke
Forward motion is achieved by stroking first on one side
and then on the other. Extend your lower arm toward the
bow and push down to plant the blade in the water. The
blade should be perpendicular to the centerline of the
kayak. Draw the blade back parallel to the centerline,
ending the stroke when your lower hand reaches your
hip. Your upper hand should be near eye level. Don’t lean
forward to extend your reach. Rather, keep your back
straight and rotate your torso. After the blade has left the
water at the end of the stroke on one side, rotate the shaft
with your control hand to set the angle for the blade on
the other side as you extend that blade forward. Repeat
from side to side, making slight adjustments as needed to
keep the kayak headed in the desired direction. Go slowly
at first to get a feel for the interaction of the boat and pad-
dle. Also make sure the region ahead of you is clear. The
kayak will respond quickly.

Chapter 17: Kayaking Skills 193
Reverse Sweep
You can also reverse the direction of the sweep to pivot
the boat in the opposite direction without changing sides.
A reverse sweep begins at the stern with the paddle shaft
at a low angle to the water. Moving the blade in a forward
arc turns the bow toward the paddling side.
Rudder
If you hold the blade vertical in the water at the rear of the
kayak, you can use the paddle as a rudder to make minor
course adjustments at the end of a forward stroke. You
guide the kayak by pushing the blade toward or away from
the rear of the boat. Angling the blade away from the kayak
turns the bow toward the paddling side. In that case, your
forward hand is slightly inboard of your back hand. Angling
the blade toward the rear of the boat, with your forward
hand slightly outboard of your back hand, turns the bow
away from the paddling side. A rudder is only effective when
the boat is moving. Deflecting water to the side creates
resistance, which is translated into a course correction. The
faster the boat is moving relative to the water, the quicker
the response. However, a rudder also creates drag, which
slows the boat. A forward sweep is generally more efficient
for making turns under way.
Draw Stroke
The draw stroke moves the kayak sideways toward the
paddle. Rotate your torso to face the side and reach out
with your lower arm. Plant the blade in the water and pull
the kayak toward it. Keep the blade almost vertical and
parallel to the side of the boat. Recover with the blade in
the water by twisting the blade perpendicular to the boat
and slipping it back to the draw position.


Chapter 17: Kayaking Skills194
Aiding a Capsized Paddler
As with the wet-exit capsize drill, the difficulty of helping
a capsized paddler depends on the water conditions and
the type of craft. A sit-on-top kayak in warm water should
present few challenges.
Your first concern if your buddy boat capsizes should be
for the safety of the paddler, not his or her equipment. If
the situation is urgent, due to injury or cold water, immedi-
ately tow the person to shore rather than chase after their
gear. If your rear deck is large enough, the capsize victim
may be able to balance on it. If your kayak is small, have
the person hold onto the rear grab loop or toggle and float
near the surface to reduce drag. If your buddy has hold of
his or her boat and needs help getting it to shore, you can
tow both the person and their kayak for short distances in
calm water.
Once on shore, you can empty the water from the swamped
boat by each holding an end and rocking the upside-down
boat fore and aft to allow water to drain from the cockpit.
Some kayaks have plugs near the ends so the water can be
drained by simply holding up one end.
Back Stroke
To stop the kayak, do a back stroke: the forward stroke
in reverse. Continue to stroke backward on opposite
sides to bring the kayak to a complete stop or to move it
backward, also called backwatering. Don’t forget to look
behind you when using the back stroke.
Stroke Combinations
The few strokes described above give you enough choices
for moving a kayak at will in calm water. Practice the strokes
separately when first learning. Master each component
sufficiently to make the kayak respond as intended. With
a bit of practice, the actions caused by the strokes should
begin to feel natural. After a while, you will not deliberately
consider what stroke to use or worry about how to execute
the stroke correctly. Instead, you will decide where you
want the kayak to go and automatically direct the paddle
to achieve that result.


Chapter 17: Kayaking Skills 195
Kayak-Over-Kayak Assist
In calm water, a capsized paddler can sometimes resume
paddling without returning to shore. Self-rescue in a
decked boat often requires a paddle float to provide stabil-
ity. However, that technique is not reviewed here because
Safety Afloat requires buddy boats for any excursion. If
the buddy boats are also in jeopardy, because the group
was remiss in not getting off the water in sufficient time
to avoid worsening conditions, the simple towing tech-
niques discussed previously should be considered. Boat-
to-boat rescues are difficult in high winds and waves.
If the capsized kayak has good flotation, and is either
self-bailing or has a pump, you can hold the boat upright
next to yours to allow the person to climb aboard.
It may also be feasible to empty a swamped kayak before
the person climbs aboard. Form a “T” with the boats and
have the swimmer steady your kayak from the rear. Pull
the swamped boat upside down across your foredeck,
and gently rock it back and forth to drain it of water.
Steady the boat next to your own, with your paddle braced
across both craft, as your buddy climbs back aboard.
Additional Skills
According to Safety Afloat, all persons participating in activ-
ities afloat other than during closely supervised instruction
must be trained and practiced in craft-handling skills, safety,
and emergency procedures. The skills reviewed above sup-
port Kayaking BSA requirements and prepare Scouts for
kayaking on flat water of limited extent, such as that at a
camp waterfront, and for float trips on flat water provided
all facets of Safety Afloat are in place. However, ocean
and river trips require additional kayaking skills, such as
the classic Eskimo roll, for dealing with waves and moving
water. Such skills are best learned under the guidance of
an experienced instructor. You will also need to develop the
ability to “read” the environment. An introduction to moving
water is provided in the next chapter.





Stand Up Paddleboarding
Stand up paddleboarding, stand up paddling, or simply SUP is a fast-growing paddle sport. Techniques for using a
paddle while standing on a board grew out of surfing but are now used for flat water and rivers as well. Although some
of the basic mechanics of using a single-bladed paddle while standing on a board are similar to those while kneeling in
a canoe, stand up paddling is different from canoeing and has its own unique characteristics and devotees.
Chapter
18


Chapter 18: Stand Up Paddleboarding198
There are several variations to stand up paddling, includ-
ing short excursions on local ponds, traveling along the
shores of large lakes, flat-water racing, river running, and
ocean surfing. This chapter provides a brief introduction
to basic flat-water safety and skills.
Equipment
Paddleboards Paddleboard designs vary based on their
use. Stability is a basic need for beginners and depends
on the width, length, thickness, and shape of the board as
well as the size of the paddler. Although lengths vary from
7 feet to 16 feet or so, beginner boards should be 10 to 12
feet long and around 30 inches wide.
The front of the board is called the nose, the back is the
tail, the top is the deck, and the sides are rails. Boards
have one to three fins on the bottom near the tail to aid
tracking (going straight).
Typical boards are rigid and are made of resin-saturated
fiber over a foam core. However, there are also inflatable
versions that are stiff enough for many uses and easier
to transport. Boards made from wood are also available.
Paddles SUP paddles are made of various materials
such as fiberglass and carbon fiber. They are longer than
canoe paddles and need to be strong to withstand the
extra torque. However, they should also be light in weight.
Most paddles have the blade angled slightly forward.
As a rough guide, the paddle should be 8 to 12 inches
taller than the paddler, based on usage and personal
preference. When the blade is immersed in the water and
the shaft is vertical, the grip hand should not be higher
than the shoulder. Some paddles are adjustable for pad-
dlers of different heights and break down into two pieces
for easier transport. Two-piece paddles are also handy as
spares on extended trips.
Life jackets The U.S. Coast Guard considers paddleboards
as vessels when they are used outside of designated swim
areas or surfing zones. Therefore, federal regulations con-
cerning life jackets, sound devices, and lights apply. BSA
Safety Afloat policies require life jackets to be worn by all
participants during Scouting paddleboard activities. Posi-
tive flotation Type III jackets are recommended for all par-
ticipants, although inflatable life jackets are appropriate in
calm water for those 16 years of age or older.
Whistles Federal rules require all vessels to carry a
sound-producing device. A whistle attached to a life
jacket is appropriate for paddleboards.
Leashes A leash can be a crucial piece of equipment in
numerous situations. Surfers use straight leashes to pre-
vent losing boards when falling in waves. A leash for a
paddleboard is also useful on calm water because even a
slight wind can blow your board away faster than you can
swim, particularly while holding a long paddle.
For flat water, a coiled leash is generally appropriate. One
end is attached to the leash plug on the tail of the board
and the other to a Velcro ankle or thigh cuff.
Leashes are also useful in rivers but can lead to entrapment
in moving water and white water. Leashes for moving water
and white water may be attached to life jackets with a quick-
release mechanism. Seek additional guidance and training
before using a paddleboard in moving water or white water.
Clothing Shoes are needed in most environments to protect
your feet when getting on and off the board. Neoprene
booties and wet suits are useful in cooler waters. A hat and
sunglasses provide sun protection.


Chapter 18: Stand Up Paddleboarding 199
Learning to Paddle
The skills needed to stay upright and move about on a
stable paddleboard in calm water are not difficult to learn.
The basics are covered below. However, like kayaking,
canoeing, or other boating activities, you will learn faster
and better with coaching from a knowledgeable instructor.
The BSA Stand Up Paddleboarding award is a good way
to begin. Scouts and Venturers should check with their
Scoutmaster or crew Advisor for course opportunities.
Unit leaders should check with their council service
center or council aquatics committee to find qualified
volunteers to teach the course.
The American Canoe Association also offers SUP skill
and instructor courses.
Board Positions
The prone position is like that used by surfers without a
paddle. It is a good safety position for stand up paddling
if you have problems with balance due to waves or if you
lose your paddle. Use your arms for propulsion as you lay
face down on the board.
You can move to a kneeling position by straddling the
board with your legs, moving forward or backward to bal-
ance the board front to back, and then pulling your legs
up to sit on the board.
Kneeling is another good safety position. This position
makes it easier to see where you are going than when in
the prone position and you get to use your paddle.
Kneeling is also a good way for beginners to get a feel for
the board before standing up.
Before standing up, find the balance point and then lay
your paddle across the board. Stand up one knee at a time.
Stand with your feet about a foot apart, with one foot one
to two inches forward of the other, and keep your knees
slightly bent.


Chapter 18: Stand Up Paddleboarding200
Forward Stroke
Grasp the paddle with the blade angled forward. Your
lower hand is on the same side as the paddle. Your oppo-
site hand on the grip crosses over the board above and
toward your lower hand so that the paddle stays close to
a vertical plane running along the side of the board.
Reach forward by rotating your shoulders to plant the
blade next to the board. This is called the catch.
Pull the board toward the paddle blade. This is the power
phase. Keep the blade close to the board to reduce the ten-
dency of the board to turn away from the paddling side.
Generate power by rotating your torso rather than pulling
in with your lower elbow. Your lower arm stays comfortably
straight throughout the power phase of the stroke.
Before your lower hand reaches your hip, angle the blade
out of the water to begin the recovery.
As you swing the blade back to the catch position, rotate
your wrists to slice the blade through the air nearly par-
allel to the water. This is called feathering and reduces
wind resistance.


Chapter 18: Stand Up Paddleboarding 201
Going Straight
During the forward stroke you should be watching where
you are going rather than looking at the paddle. After a
few strokes on the same side, you will notice you are
starting a wide turn away from your paddling side. The
easiest way for beginners to go straight is to switch sides
every few strokes.
As you gain experience, you can add a gentle course cor-
rection at the end of your stroke. Standing slightly toward
your paddling side will lower the rail and may also help
you track straight.
Turning and Stopping
To do a wide turn, keep paddling on one side with the
blade farther away from the rail during the power phase
of the stroke. For a sharper turn, follow a forward stroke
with a reverse, or back, stroke on the opposite side of the
board. The back stroke is also used for stopping.
Beyond the Basics
There are additional strokes and maneuvers to learn
after the basics. For example, a sweep is more efficient
for turning than a back stroke. During a sweep, the blade
is swept in an arc away from the board. A forward sweep
turns the board away from the paddling side. A reverse
sweep turns the board toward the paddling side. Step-
ping back during the turn will raise the nose and make the
turn even faster.


Chapter 18: Stand Up Paddleboarding202
Falls and Recovery
Try to anticipate and avoid situations that may lead to
a fall. For example, if a motorboat with a large wake
approaches from a distance, you may want to kneel until
the waves arrive and die down.
However, sooner or later you are going to fall. If you feel
yourself losing balance and cannot easily recover by
bracing with your paddle, try to fall feet first away from
the board with your paddle held to the side.
To recover, approach the board from the center and,
using the hand well, pull/lift yourself up over the rail and
onto the deck, then slide around into the prone position.
Unless there is a strong current, you can let your paddle
float next to the board and retrieve it after you get on.
Other Safety Concerns
If you apply Safety Afloat concepts to stand up paddle-
boarding, you will anticipate and avoid most hazardous
situations for safe flat-water paddling. Always wear a life
jacket and paddle with a buddy in a safe environment for
which you possess the necessary skills.
Seek further instruction prior to paddleboarding on rivers

Paddling on Flowing Water
River paddling has several allures. Drifting down a river with the current is much easier than fighting a strong headwind
on a lake. Running an obstacle course over small drops through a boulder garden adds thrills and challenges. However,
safely meeting the challenges of moving water requires knowledge and skill. Basic flat-water skills provide a good
foundation but are not sufficient for river paddling.

River Basics
All free-flowing rivers have currents, but not all rivers have
the drops and obstacles that create whitewater rapids.
There are many more miles of rivers navigable by small
boats without rapids than there are with white water.
Therefore, we’ll begin with currents. The strength of a
current depends on the amount of water and the speed.
The amount of water changes with seasonal runoff
and can increase rapidly due to upstream rainfall or
convergence of tributaries. The speed of the current for
a fixed amount of water varies with the width and depth
of the channel and the gradient, that is, how much the
river bottom slopes downhill. The flow of a broad river
constricted into a narrow canyon speeds up. The speed
of the current slows down exiting the canyon onto a flat,
broad plain.
The shape a river takes depends on the total flow and
local geology. Forces within the earth raise mountains,
but rivers shape the land and eventually move material
from the mountains into the sea. Competent river paddlers
know how to read a river, and reading a river is easier if
you understand some simple geologic concepts of fluvial
(river) systems.
In mountain country, water cascading downhill erodes
weaker rocks to form channels. The channels tend to
be steep and narrow with abrupt drops, and that leads
to white water. Eventually, the rivers form wide valleys
and wear the land into broad plateaus or plains. Rivers
in valleys or on the plains continuously rework the soils
and sediments they have deposited in previous ages. The
channels are not straight conduits to the sea, but rather
twist and turn or meander. In steep valleys, the mean-
ders are gentle curves. On flat plains, meanders can form
large, complicated loops. Each meander has a cutting
edge that erodes sediments. The curve cuts through the
land and becomes tighter. Eventually, high water dur-
ing floods will break through the neck and temporarily
straighten the river. The process then starts over. In flood
stage, water extends from bank to bank, or beyond. In
low water, the flow may break up into several different
channels, each meandering within the overall width of
the riverbed. Rivers nearing the sea may also divide into
numerous smaller channels, with the current switching
direction depending on the tide.
The meander process has important implications for the
boater. As the river switches from one curve to the other,
there will be short stretches of relatively straight channel.
In a straight channel, the fastest current is in the middle.
Because faster currents erode quicker than slower cur-
rents, the deepest water will also be near the center of a
straight channel. In a curved riverbed, the fastest current
and deepest water will be on the outside of the bend; the
current on the inside of the bend will be less. Larger sedi-
ment particles fall out of suspension as the current slows,
so the inside curves of a river often have shallow sandy
stretches that make good launching and landing sites.
In low water, you will want to travel in the channel to avoid
grounding or hitting the bottom with your paddle. That
means you will travel from one side of the river to the other to
stay on the outside of the meanders. Cutting across a bend
near the inside bank might be shorter, but you normally will
make better time if you stay in the current. If the river splits
into several channels, follow the one that seems to have the
greatest flow.
If you find yourself on a river with the water rising, you
may wish to avoid the main current while looking for a
safe place to take out early. In that case, stay toward the
inside of a curve, and toward the bank rather than in the
center of straight stretches.


Chapter 19: Paddling on Flowing Water 205
Strainers
Trees often grow along rivers, even on the plains. As the
meander cuts away the bank along the outside bend of a
river, trees fall and become lodged across the strongest
current. These strainers or sweepers can pose significant
hazards to the paddler. Look well ahead for strainers, and
be particularly careful coming around tight bends where
visibility is limited. If there is a strainer ahead in the main
current, then hug the inside of the bend to avoid it. Stop and
scout if there is any doubt of getting around the obstruc-
tion. Although many strainers are located near the cut
bank, floods can dislodge trees and move them just about
anywhere. Some can be hiding just under the surface.
Avoid any branches sticking out of the water.
Undercut Cliffs
If the cut bank is formed from rock rather than soil, erosion
will be slower, and meanders tend to have less curvature.
However, erosion still occurs. Scouring over the years
will cut into the rock below the waterline while leaving
the cliff face above the waterline intact. Different rocks
erode at different rates, so the profile of the bank may
vary above and below the water. In some rivers, bottom
erosion will match or exceed erosion to the side, and you
may be able to drift along in the shadow of an overhang-
ing cliff. However, in other rivers, particularly at normal or
high water flows, underwater currents may sweep in an
undercut channel just below the surface. Such features
may be invisible from above and can be very dangerous if
a boat is swept underwater. Because such hazards may
not be apparent from the surface, be leery of strong cur-
rents against rock cliffs and check river guidebooks and
others who have traveled the river before. If the river is
not wide and slow enough to avoid the undercut bank, the
area should be portaged.
Low-Head Dams
and Horizon Lines
Many smaller rivers have low-head dams or weirs
stretching in a level line from one bank to the other. The
river falls evenly over the structure and often creates an
extremely dangerous recirculating flow, or hydraulic, at
the foot of the dam. These are aptly called “drowning
machines” and should never be run. Identify any dams
during trip planning and make sure each can be safely
portaged. When on the river, look well ahead for a horizon
line indicating you are approaching a low-head dam (or
waterfall). The abrupt drop in river level below a low-head
dam makes the river appear to disappear momentarily
beyond the level horizon line across the river.


Chapter 19: Paddling on Flowing Water206
Current Measures
The total amount of water passing a point in a set time
is measured in cubic feet per sec (cfs). River flows are
often reported daily in newspapers and on newscasts,
particularly for rivers where the flow depends on dam
releases. Other rivers have gauges that measure the
height of the water relative to some datum. Neither a flow
report nor a gauge reading by itself will tell you if there
is sufficient water for an enjoyable float trip, or too much
water for a safe trip. A large river at low levels may flow
several thousand cfs; the same level in a smaller river
would indicate a major flood. Check river guidebooks for
sources of flow information for specific rivers and sug-
gested safe levels, and note the level during any trip you
take for future reference.
If you suspect the water is rising during a float trip, take a
short break onshore and note the level by placing a rock
or stick at the river’s edge. If the water covers your gauge
after a few minutes, it’s time to consider your alternate
takeouts. If you are spending the night on the river, set up
a makeshift gauge and check it in the morning.
The most important thing to remember in river paddling
is that moving water has tremendous, unrelenting power.
Suppose a canoe in a current strikes a rock and comes
to a sudden stop. Since energy increases with the square
of the speed, the energy required to stop the canoe from
5 miles per hour will be four times that at 2.5 mph, even
though the speed only doubled. However, the energy also
depends on the mass. The impact on a rock of an empty
canoe drifting at 5 mph is about the same as dropping the
canoe on the rock from a height of 10 inches—not some-
thing you want to do, particularly on a sharp rock, but the
canoe will likely survive. Now swamp the canoe so it is
drifting along full of water. The impact on the rock will
now be similar to dropping an empty canoe on the rock
from 28 feet. You don’t want to be between a swamped
canoe and a rock any more than you want to try to catch
an empty canoe dropped from a two-story building.
You can also get a feel for the power in moving water by
comparing it to the power in moving air. Water weighs
770 times more than air, so water flowing at only 3 mph
has roughly the same energy per cubic foot as a hurri-
cane-force 80 mph wind. Put another way, standing on
top of a car traveling at 80 mph would be very difficult
(and extremely foolish). Standing neck-deep in a 3 mph
current would be about as hard.
Also note, however, that how you position yourself
influences your interaction with the wind or the current.
Point a closed umbrella into a wind, and the force on the
umbrella is small. Open the umbrella pointed into the wind
and the force increases significantly, but not as much as
it would if you opened the umbrella to catch the wind.
The same applies to a boat in a current. Point the boat
with the current, and the force will be less than with
the boat turned sideways to the current. If a swamped
canoe is snagged by a strainer with gunwales
facing downstream, the force will be less than with the
gunwales facing upstream.


Chapter 19: Paddling on Flowing Water 207
Sideslips
Most of the time, you should keep the canoe parallel to
the current and make course adjustments by moving the
canoe sideways. In a solo canoe or kayak, use either a
draw stroke or a pry. In a tandem canoe, one person does
a pry while the other does a draw. Sideslips are used to
align the boat to pass between bridge pilings, to follow
the channel in shallow rivers, and to avoid obstacles such
as a submerged tree lurking just below the surface.
Do not attempt to avoid an obstacle at the last minute by
using sweeps to pivot or otherwise turn the boat across
the current. If you do hit a hidden object with the boat
parallel to the current, chances are it will be a glanc-
ing blow and you will be able to continue on your way. If
you turn sideways to the current just above an obstacle,
you will likely broach and become pinned with the cur-
rent pushing both ends of the boat around the object. It
doesn’t take much current to bend a canoe in half. If a
broach appears unavoidable, try to lean the boat toward
the obstacle so that the current will flow around the bot-
tom of the hull rather than against a kayak deck or into a
canoe between the gunwales. Your first concern, how-
ever, is to avoid being trapped between the boat and the
obstacle. If the boat does not quickly slide past the object,
get clear of the boat, fast, either by climbing on top of the
obstacle or by swimming to the side.
Tandem canoeing in a river requires teamwork. The stern
paddler is sometimes in a better position to make general
course corrections, but the bow paddler is more likely to
first notice an obstacle just below the surface. Clear verbal
communication is a must, but a team used to paddling
together will automatically take cues from each other.
For example, if the bow paddler begins a draw or a pry
to avoid an object, an experienced stern paddler should
automatically perform a matching stroke to move the
boat sideways.
Gate Test: The Scout gate test shown in the White-
water merit badge pamphlet is not a substitute for
experience on moving water but does help develop
the quick, automatic skills needed to quickly move a
boat sideways, forward, and backward without delib-
eration. It also develops teamwork between tandem
canoeists. The course shown is done between poles
or floats 4 feet apart. Strive to complete the course in
less than 160 seconds without touching the markers.

Chapter 19: Paddling on Flowing Water208
Ferries
River paddlers strive to use the power of the current to
advantage, rather than trying to work against it. One such
strategy is used to cross from one side of a river to the
other. You can move across a current with draws and pries
while drifting downstream. That keeps your craft paral-
lel to the current, which is good, but you’ll travel a long
way downriver before you make it all the way across. You
might be tempted to strike straight across, but that will turn
your boat broadside to the current and you will still sweep
downstream. Alternately, you can stop near one bank,
turn around, and paddle upstream at an angle with your
bow pointed ahead of where you expect to land. The last
maneuver is one version of a ferry, named for an analo-
gous technique used by a barge connected to each bank
with a rope or cable. To understand how a ferry makes use
of the current, it’s useful to look at the barge analogy.
A barge connected by pulleys to a line stretched across
the river can be pulled across by grasping the rope.
However, if the barge is set at a slight angle to the cur-
rent, the water itself will help move the ferry from one
side to the other. Current striking the upstream side of the
barge pushes it sideways as well as downstream. Ten-
sion in the rope cancels out the downstream portion, and
the remaining force will move the barge across the cur-
rent without the ferrymen pulling on the rope. (There is
a counter force at the narrow end of the barge, but it is
smaller than the force on the long side.) To move back
to the other side, the ferrymen reverse the angle to the
current. The upstream end is always angled toward the
opposite bank in the direction of desired travel.
If a canoe or kayak is paddled upstream with the bow
angled slightly toward the opposite shore, the current will
provide the sideways force while the paddlers substitute
for the rope. If the paddlers are able to match the current
in strength, the boat will slide across like the barge. More
likely, there will be downstream drift, but not as much as if
paddling straight across. A larger angle speeds the cross-
ing but also results in more slippage. In tandem boats, the
person in the stern holds the angle with pries and draws
while the person in the bow attempts to hold position with
forward strokes. A solo paddler has to maintain the angle
while also moving against the current.
A downstream ferry is done with the boat facing down-
stream, but with back strokes used to counter the cur-
rent. The stern is angled toward the opposite bank.
Note that it is the angle of the boat to the current, not to the
shore, that determines the ferry angle. Also note that ferries
are more difficult if the upstream end is trimmed lower than
the downstream end. An unbalanced boat will work like a
weather vane with the deep end swinging downstream.
Fast or Slow?
During upstream and downstream ferries, the boat is
slowed relative to the current. Some strokes depend on
the boat moving either faster or slower than the current.
If you are moving along at a good pace on flat water and
set the blade as a rudder at the end of a stroke, the boat
will quickly veer to one side or the other. If you hold water
to stop the boat, it slows rapidly. If you are drifting with
a current going at that same speed, a set rudder angle


Chapter 19: Paddling on Flowing Water 209
won’t work and holding the paddle vertically fixed to the
boat won’t slow you down. Changes in motion require
acceleration, that is, movement of the paddle relative
to the water. In the flat-water case, you deflect water
by holding the forward-moving blade against the resis-
tance of the stationary water. When drifting with a cur-
rent, the same actions don’t work since the boat, paddle,
and water are all moving together. If you paddle faster
than the current, then the rudder and holding water will
again work as expected. If you are moving slower than
the current, then holding the blade fixed relative to the
boat works as it would if you were backing water.
Moving faster than the current is naturally accomplished
using forward strokes and helps maintain control of the
boat. However, moving slower than the current, as in the
ferries, is also a valuable option and can provide addi-
tional time to react in tricky situations.
Eddies
Any fixed obstacle blocks the current and creates a
“shadow” zone immediately downstream. Water flows
sideways from the deflected current to fill in the shielded
region. If the obstacle is wide enough, water will actually
flow upstream for a short distance. The area of reverse
flow is known as an eddy, and the boundary between
downstream and upstream flow is called an eddy line.
Boaters crossing an eddy line unawares risk capsize as
the opposing currents carry the bow and stern in different
directions and the boat pivots.
Whitewater paddlers make use of small eddies behind
midstream rocks as rest stops and scouting locations. To
do so, they need to develop precise eddy turns to quickly
move into a tight location. Paddlers on larger rivers with-
out obstacles are more likely to encounter eddies on the
inside of tight bends, behind weirs extended partway
into the current, or behind bridge pilings or other artifi-
cial structures. In most such situations, the eddies are
avoided altogether by staying in the main channel clear of
any obstacles. However, sometimes a takeout point may
be at an eddy site.
To enter an eddy, the boat should be pointed toward the
upstream start of the eddy line at roughly a 45-degree angle.
As the bow crosses the eddy line, it will automatically turn
upstream as the stern continues downstream. Paddlers
should drive the boat into the eddy as it pivots. A paddle
blade planted on the upstream side of the bow will make the
boat pivot faster. The bow person in a tandem canoe can use
either a draw or a cross draw stroke, depending on the pad-
dling side. This is a stationary draw. The object is to catch
the upstream current with the blade—it is not necessary to
pull against it. The paddler should be ready to hang on. The
boat is leaned upstream into the turn.
You can slip out of a broad eddy near its tail to continue
downstream. However, a broad eddy in a river free of
rapids is a good place to practice some skills needed for
white water. Try a peel-out with the boat facing upstream.
Drop downstream a bit against the eddy and align the
boat facing upstream with the eddy line. Drive the boat
forward to cross the eddy line at an angle. A bow paddler
uses a stationary draw to pull the bow into the current as
the boat pivots to head downstream. The boat is leaned
downstream into the turn.


Chapter 19: Paddling on Flowing Water210
River Signals
The lead boat on a river trip should contain experienced
paddlers who, ideally, have traveled that particular river
several times before under different water conditions.
The boat next in line should follow the path of the lead
boat and make sure the boat behind does the same,
unless the lead boat signals otherwise. Standard river
signals using paddles have been developed so that infor-
mation from the lead boat can be clearly communicated
to boats behind. Review these signals at the start of the
trip. Caution those in the group to avoid pointing at haz-
ards. That is too easily mistaken as indicating a direction
to proceed.
Stop Help Are you OK?
Run down center or all clearRun left (facing upstream) Run right (facing upstream)


Chapter 19: Paddling on Flowing Water 211
Self-Rescue
Everyone on a river trip needs to know how to react
to a capsize in moving water. If feasible, stay with the
swamped boat. It provides support and will be easy for
rescuers to spot. Stay at the upstream end to avoid being
caught between the boat and an obstacle. Slowly swim
the boat to the side while waiting for another boat to pro-
vide a tow.
Do not jeopardize personal safety in an attempt to retrieve
gear. Swim for shore if:
• You have been thrown clear of your boat.
• The water is very cold.
• You are approaching rapids or other hazards.
In deep water free of obstructions, swimming a fast for-
ward stroke is feasible if the water is cold and the dis-
tance short. However, in shallow water, or in water with
obstacles, swim on your back with your feet and legs
pointed downstream near the surface. Swim backward to
ferry toward shore or to avoid obstacles.
If thrown a line, float on your back, feet downstream, with
the line over your shoulder and held to your chest. Do not
attempt to pull yourself along the line. Instead, swing with
the current toward shore.
Do not attempt to stand in shallow water above your
knees. If your foot becomes wedged between rocks on
the bottom, you may be unable to keep your head above
water against the force of the current.
If you are being swept toward a strainer, change from the
feetfirst position on your back to a headfirst position on
your stomach with your head out of the water and your
legs at the surface. Try to climb onto or over the strainer
instead of getting sucked underneath.


Chapter 19: Paddling on Flowing Water212
Boat Assists
If your buddy boat capsizes ahead of you in a current,
first look for an obvious cause. You may need to maneu-
ver around a submerged obstruction to avoid swamping
yourself. If so, pick up swimmers after they float clear.
Quickly check to see that paddlers are conscious with
their heads above water. A kayaker needs to either exit
the craft or perform a roll. Next, look ahead for other pos-
sible hazards and decide whether to approach swimmers
from the left or the right. In unobstructed water, have
swimmers hold onto the ends of the rescue boat as you
ferry toward a safe landing site onshore. You may need to
drift downstream until a safe exit comes into view. Down-
stream craft should back water and position themselves
to assist swimmers or retrieve loose gear. Everyone’s first
concern should be for the swimmers. Boats and other
gear are secondary concerns.
If you have maneuvering room and the capsized boat-
ers are drifting with their boat, you can slowly tow the
swamped boat and the swimmers if they are able to hold
onto your boat’s grab loop or painter.


Chapter 19: Paddling on Flowing Water 213
Throwing Assists
Boats that are significantly ahead of a capsized craft
may have time to land and get ready for a throwing assist
using a throw bag. A person setting up for a throwing
assist should have secure footing, ideally above a good
landing spot for the swimmer. If the bag is cinched shut
with a plastic slide, make sure the top is open enough for
the line to play out freely. Hold the bag in one hand and
the loop in the end of the line in the other hand. Try to get
the swimmer’s attention by yelling “Rope!”
Throw the line while the swimmer is still slightly upstream.
A good throw should lay the rope across the victim’s
chest, but you will need to allow for a moving target. Nor-
mally the bag is thrown underhand, but an overhand toss
may be used to clear weeds near the shore.
If the river is free of obstructions and the shoreline is
clear, the rescuer can walk downstream and inland to
pull the swimmer toward shore without having to hold the
swimmer against the force of the current.
If there is not an easy path along the bank, be prepared
for considerable force if the line becomes taut. Additional
rescuers can help hold the line. If necessary, belay the
line around a stout tree or large rock. Let the current
swing the swimmer toward shore. Alternatively, run the
line around the back of your hips, and brace your feet in a
wide stance. You should be able to release the line at any
time, from yourself if you are about to be pulled in, and
from the belay if the victim gets tangled in the line and
needs it slack.

Tubing
Drifting down a shallow, lazily flowing stream on a warm, sunny day on tubes, air mattresses, or small rafts is a
pleasant way to pass the time. Even though the activity is akin to swimming, once you leave the confines of a swim-
ming area to venture down moving water, BSA Safety Afloat standards apply. All participants must pass the BSA
swimmer classification test, wear a life jacket, and have a buddy close by. Make sure you know the water ahead
and allow plenty of time to meet your float plan.
Ideally, the tubes should be designed for river floating, with concealed valves, a mesh or net cover, and grab lines.
Be wary of exposed valve stems on inflated tire inner tubes. Auxiliary gear should include shoes, sun protection,
and plenty of safe drinking water.
Tubes are generally controlled with the hands, although small fins or hand paddles may be useful. Canoe and kayak
paddles are generally not worth the trouble—tubes tend to spin.
Since tubes are difficult to control, avoid all but the gentlest of currents (Class I as defined in the next chapter).
If you want the adventure of white water, stick with a canoe, kayak, or whitewater raft.


Whitewater
Chapter
20
Increase the gradient of a river with a decent flow; then throw in drops, exposed rocks, and constrictions, and
whitewater results. Safety on flowing water requires additional knowledge and skill beyond those needed for calm
water. Safe whitewater excursions require even more expertise, which is best learned in stages from a skilled,
experienced instructor.


Chapter 20: Whitewater216
Closed V
Add obstacles in a current, and reading a river requires an
additional vocabulary. Note that many of these features
will be easier to identify looking down on the river from
a stationary point on the bank. They may be hard to spot
from river level. A rock or tree near the surface will deflect
water to the sides and produce a V shape in the water with
the point facing upstream. Sideslip upstream of such a fea-
ture to avoid the obstacle and a possible broach.
Open V
An open or downstream V forms between two obstacles
such as isolated rocks or a break in a rock ledge. The
wide end of the V is upstream and the point is down-
stream. Downstream V’s often indicate the best route.
Aim for the point, or just to one side.
Standing Waves
The faster water flowing in an open V will often pro-
duce standing waves, or haystacks, as it hits slower
water downstream. Waves in a river are often caused by
changes in flow rate, rather than by obstacles below the
surface. A line of small waves just below a downstream V
often indicates deeper water and a good route. However,
if the waves are too large, particularly if they are breaking
back upstream, you may need to avoid them, particularly
in an open canoe.
Eddies
Any stationary object that protrudes above the surface
will deflect current to the side and produce a counter flow
as the water fills in behind the object. If the object is wide
enough, the counter flow, or eddy, will be big enough to
shield a boat from the downstream current. A popular
strategy for running long rapids is to hop from eddy to
eddy to rest and scout the next stretch. An eddy line
separates downstream from upstream flow and must be
crossed correctly to take advantage of the shadow zone
behind the object.

Pillows and Pour-Overs
A deep rock in a strong current will produce a boil on
the surface downstream of the rock. A pillow will form
as water pours over a rock near the surface. Pillows,
particularly over large flat rocks, can cause calm-looking
areas in rapids and should be avoided. If the rock
breaks the surface, the water piling against the upstream
side will produce a pillow that will help push you away
from the rock if you strike it at a glancing angle rather
than broadside.
Holes
Given the right combination of rock shape and current
strength, water flowing around and over a large rock just
beneath the surface will create a depression, or hole,
that is filled by a large standing wave that curls back
toward the rock. Unlike eddies, holes should be avoided.
If a break in a ledge or between rocks is accompanied by
a steep drop, the water cascading down will also form
a hole that is backfilled from downstream. Water pour-
ing over an unbroken ledge can produce a dangerous
hydraulic similar to a low-head dam.
Drops
Amazingly high sheer drops, or waterfalls, are run by
experts in decked boats willing to take extreme risks.
Scouting units should portage such features. Several
rock ledges may create a series of smaller drops. These
should be studied carefully from shore. Portage any situ-
ation where there is not sufficient space to line up the
next drop after the first, or where an error anywhere in
the series exposes boaters to an unacceptable hazard
farther downstream.
Shoals
Rivers at low flows or with stretches where the channel is
wide and shallow may have sections of “dancing” water
or shoals caused by numerous small rocks near the
surface. Stay close to the outside of river bends where
the channel is deepest, and aim for any obvious down-
stream V’s. Be ready to step out of the boat if it drags bot-
tom in very shallow water. Boats may be lined through
short sections of shallow shoals, but be wary of tripping
hazards and foot entrapment.


Chapter 20: Whitewater218
International Scale
of River Difficulty
American Whitewater maintains the U.S. version of
a river rating system used to compare the difficulty and
risks of various rivers at different flow levels. Check out
www.americanwhitewater.org for details. The scale
is at best a rough estimate. Particular rapids may not fit
easily into the categories, and individuals from different
parts of the country may interpret the scale differently.
However, a river purported to have numerous Class
III to Class IV rapids should be more challenging than
a river with mainly Class II rapids but a single Class IV
rapid that is easily portaged. Therefore, the scale can be
used to help decide whether to embark on a section of a
river, but you should supplement the rating system with
individual knowledge and detailed descriptions found in
river guidebooks. Even then, keep in mind that a river may
change from one run to the next, even if the flow is similar.
Note that rapids at the lower or upper end of the range
may have – or + designations. See the above website
for the complete text of the classification scheme for
Class V and VI.
Even though the Class I description seems benign com-
pared with the others, don’t forget that any moving water
can be hazardous, particularly to those unprepared for
currents and cold water. Floating a river at flood stage is
not recommended regardless of wave size or obstacles.
Class I: Easy
Photo illustration
Fast-moving water with riffles and small waves. Few
obstructions, all obvious and easily missed with little
training. Risk to swimmers is slight; self-rescue is easy.
Class II: Novice
Photo illustration
Straightforward rapids with wide, clear channels that
are evident without scouting. Occasional maneuvering
may be required, but rocks and medium-sized waves
are easily missed by trained paddlers. Swimmers are
seldom injured; group assistance, while helpful, is
seldom needed.
Class III: Intermediate
Photo illustration
Rapids with moderate, irregular waves that may be dif-
ficult to avoid and that can swamp an open canoe. Com-
plex maneuvers in fast current and good boat control in
tight passages or around ledges are often required; large
waves or strainers may be present but are easily avoided.
Strong eddies and powerful current effects can be found,
particularly on large-volume rivers. Scouting is advisable
for inexperienced parties. Injuries while swimming are
rare; self-rescue is usually easy but group assistance
may be required to avoid long swims.


Chapter 20: Whitewater 219
Class IV: Advanced
Photo illustration
Intense, powerful, but predictable rapids requiring pre-
cise boat handling in turbulent water. Depending on the
character of the river, it may feature large, unavoidable
waves and holes or constricted passages demanding fast
maneuvers under pressure. A fast, reliable eddy turn may
be needed to initiate maneuvers, scout rapids, or rest.
Rapids may require “must” moves above dangerous haz-
ards. Scouting may be necessary the first time down. Risk
of injury to swimmers is moderate to high, and water con-
ditions may make self-rescue difficult. Group assistance
for rescue is often essential but requires practiced skills.
A strong Eskimo roll is highly recommended.

These runs have almost never been attempted and often
exemplify the extremes of difficulty, unpredictability,
and danger.
Whitewater Gear
In North Woods lake country, long treks favor touring
canoes even though the trip may include short stretches
on rivers between lakes. Many seasoned canoeists eas-
ily take on Class I and Class II rapids without special gear,
and some experts can handle Class III rapids in a long,
open canoe full of gear. However, they are exceptions.
Those seeking the challenges of white water should meet
those challenges with boats and gear suited to the task.
Whitewater canoes and kayaks have short, rockered hulls
for easy maneuvering. Kayaks have small cockpits with
spray skirts. Canoes have saddles and thigh straps rather
than seats, and are filled with flotation. Hull materials are
impact-resistant.
A strong, properly fitted helmet should be worn whenever
upsets are likely in white water. Helmets are essential in
any craft in Class III rapids or above, and should be used
in kayaks and decked canoes for most river travel. The
head of a paddler in an open canoe generally stays above
water during a capsize, but needs a helmet for protec-
tion when swimming through rapids. A paddler in a kayak
or decked canoe rolls head down, even if doing a wet
exit rather than a roll, and therefore always needs head
protection in rivers with rocks, shallow water, or other
obstructions. Use helmets designed for white water;
don’t rely on a bicycle helmet to meet the need. Material
should protect the forehead, temples, ears, and the base
of the skull. Most helmets feature holes that allow water
to drain. The helmet should feel snug but comfortable.


Chapter 20: Whitewater220
Paddling Skills
The basic skills needed for river travel were covered
in the last section. Paddlers in any craft should be able
to travel forward and backward parallel to the current
and move sideways while staying aligned with the cur-
rent. However, a boat in white water seldom moves in a
straight line or even where it is pointed. Frequent turns
occur at all angles to the current. Paddlers in white water
need to perfect ferries, eddy turns, and eddy peel-outs.
Various braces and stationary draws, both onside and
offside, help with those maneuvers. Kayakers must learn
wet exits with a skirt and need to perfect a roll in moving
water if they expect to tackle rapids with higher ratings.
Some of those skills are discussed in the Whitewater
merit badge pamphlet and the BSA Fieldbook. Those
will not be repeated here: Whitewater skills must be
acquired through demonstration and practice rather than
picked up by reading.
It is feasible for individuals or groups to move systemi-
cally from flat-water to whitewater skills. A day or two of
instruction and practice on flat water with a competent
instructor can safely be followed by a day trip on a Class
I river guided by an instructor familiar with that run. Sub-
sequent trips can be on more difficult sections of river.
Some rivers are of the pool-and-drop variety with long
stretches of Class I water interrupted by short, isolated
rapids. The drops can be run multiple times to perfect
skills without the danger of a mishap carrying a capsized
boat into another hazard. Once the group learns the skills
in a safe, relaxed setting, more ambitious trips can be
considered. That is a viable approach for a Scout troop or
a Venturing crew with capable leadership to gain the
skills needed for paddling at the Class II level along with
an occasional Class III (-) challenge. Numerous rivers will
fit those categories; there should be plenty of variety to
keep the group engaged without the need for higher and
higher skill levels. As new members cycle through the
unit, they can be brought up to speed with more experi-
enced youth without having to bar new members from
unit trips because of skill level. However, other training
options are available if unit leadership lacks basic
instructional capability, or a Venturing crew really wants
to tackle the nearby Class III to IV river.
Learning by doing is fine in concept, but can leave large
gaps if the procedure is not systematically arranged
by a knowledgeable leader. BSA units lacking internal
resources may get useful assistance from local pad-
dling clubs. Ideally, the local club will have volunteer
instructors certified by the American Canoe Association
or a similar organization. ACA instructors offer canoeing
and kayaking courses from basic to advanced, from flat
water to different levels of white water. The ACA also has
courses for float-trip leaders. Check out the ACA website
at www.americancanoe.org for course outlines and con-
tacts with affiliated clubs.
Failing a local volunteer connection, there are many com-
mercial paddling schools where a unit can obtain profes-
sional instruction to jump-start a whitewater specialty.
Course location, duration, and price are all practical
considerations in the choice of a paddling school. Also
evaluate schools based on years of operation, type and
condition of equipment, instructor training programs, and
recommendations from other BSA leaders.


Chapter 20: Whitewater 221
Whitewater Strategy
Even a properly trained and equipped group faces impor-
tant decisions when deciding whether and how to run a
particular rapid.
• Know the river and the group. Knowledge of the
river and the skills and limitations of the group are
important aspects of trip planning. Once on the river,
that knowledge is used to gather the group at a safe
landing above any feature that needs scouting from
the bank. The only portage around a waterfall may
be on one side above a turn in the river. Hugging the
opposite cliff side until the horizon line becomes vis-
ible around the bend may not allow sufficient time
to avoid the hazard. Proceed into a rapid only if it is
known to be easily within the capability of everyone
in the group at current water levels. Otherwise, stop
and scout from the shore. Rivers where scouting can
only be done on the fly from one eddy to the next are
for experts only.
• Scout intelligently. Walk downstream along the
bank until the end of the rapid is in clear view, that
is, until a point is reached where everyone boating
or swimming the rapid will be able to regroup and
land if necessary to scout the next feature. Then look
back upstream to determine if there are one or more
points to safely exit the rapid. Visually work upstream
of likely exits to connect clear paths around interme-
diate obstacles until you arrive at likely entry points
to the rapid. Then consider the plausible routes indi-
vidually and discuss the pros and cons of each path
as a group. In some cases there will be only a single
viable path that does not require complex maneu-
vering beyond the group’s capability. In other cases,
there may be one easy route, and additional paths of
increasing difficulty. Note that features clearly visible
from a high bank may be difficult to see from water
level. Safely running the rapid may depend critically
on either lining up an intermediate chute or avoid-
ing a dangerous hole. Look for landmarks, if any, that
should be obvious on the water and factor those into
the evaluation.
• Decide. Everyone in the group needs to individually
decide whether they wish to run the rapid and, if so,
which path to take. Different members of the group
may have different preferences. No one should ever
be pressured to run a rapid they view with concern.
However, individuals may also overestimate their
ability or discount the consequences of an error. For
youth groups, adult leaders assume responsibility for
the safety of those under their care and may elect to
have individuals or the entire party portage a rapid
that some group members would attempt on their
own. The following questions will help individuals
and leaders reach a reasonable conclusion.
1. Is there a safe path? If there is an unavoidable
steep drop into a hole, if there is not enough room
between ledges to align one narrow chute with
another, or if the only chute with sufficient water
depth runs straight into a boulder, the decision is
easy. Everyone portages.
2. What maneuvers are required? Perhaps the
paddlers need to sideslip past a rock near the point
of a downstream V while negotiating moderate-sized
standing waves. Maybe a short ferry is needed to
align one chute with another, or perhaps an eddy
needs to be caught to move from one side of the river
to the other. Any course that moves across the cur-
rent in short distances may require precise execution.
3. Does each person have the skills necessary
to make those maneuvers? If a solo kayaker or
a tandem canoe team missed an easy ferry or eddy
earlier, they probably are not ready if tighter moves
are required for the rapid under consideration. The
goal is to keep the boat always under control. Pad-
dlers who rely on luck rather than skill to maintain
control during specific maneuvers should opt out.


Chapter 20: Whitewater222
4. What are the consequences if the maneuvers
are not successful? A common result of a botched
maneuver is that a paddler becomes a swimmer. No
one should enter a rapid in a boat if they are unwilling
to swim that same rapid in case of an upset. The risk
to a swimmer often depends on where in a rapid a
capsize occurs. If the only critical maneuver occurs
near the end of the rapid, the swimmer may simply
be swept into a safe pool. If difficult maneuvers are
required near the start of the rapid, the results of an
error are more dire if the swimmer faces steep drops,
holes, or undercut rocks. When calculating the mar-
gin for error, also consider the temperature of the
water. Longer swims increase the likelihood of hypo-
thermia. The other risk of a botched maneuver is the
loss of a craft. Consider the chances of a boat wrap-
ping around a rock for upsets in different parts of the
rapid. Finally, consider the chances that a boater will
be pinned in a craft.
5. Are the consequences acceptable? This is the
kicker. Risk to life and limb should always be mini-
mized. But a swimmer swept into a deep pool after
a short swim in warm water may only slow the trip
down a bit. In between the obvious are situations
where the potential loss of gear and time are more
inconvenient than hazardous. Remember that a float
trip is meant to be an enjoyable experience. Just
because you have planned ahead and can get every-
one off the water safely doesn’t mean that a lost boat
is an acceptable risk. When in doubt, err on the side
of caution. There will be other rapids where the group
will have fun and gain experience.
Whitewater Rafting
Units without the training or gear to undertake a white-
water trip on their own have other options for catching
the thrills and challenges of white water. Commercial
rafting trips cater to people with limited experience. Short
trips may take only a few hours. Other trips take a week
or more. In oared rafts, participants are along for the ride.
A professional rower maneuvers the raft through the rap-
ids. In paddle rafts, riders participate by paddling under
the direction of a trained guide at the stern. The rafts are
large and stable and can handle heavy white water. How-
ever, realize that a raft ride on a wild river is not the same
as an amusement park ride. Statistics compiled by Ameri-
can Whitewater show that commercial whitewater-rafting
trips are not without risks, including fatalities. Even the
largest rafts can flip and send passengers for a swim.
Enthused paddlers on paddle rafts can inadvertently
strike one another. The key to a safe, enjoyable experi-
ence is a competent rafting service.


Chapter 20: Whitewater 223
Use the following criteria to compare rafting services:
• Years of operation. New outfitters may operate
to the highest standards, but those who have been
around awhile and still stay booked have a proven
success record. However, experienced companies
may hire inexperienced guides.
• Safety record. Operators are unlikely to share poor
safety records but may use clear records in their adver-
tising. Check various websites for additional informa-
tion, including contacts with government regulators.
• Condition of equipment. Helmets, life jackets,
rafts, paddles, food storage containers, and other
equipment need not be brand new, but should be
clean, functional, and up-to-date.
• Safety policies. Rafting services cater to the gen-
eral public and therefore may not have guidelines
as strict as those of the BSA concerning ages and
swimming ability. However, there should be reason-
able restrictions based on age and physical con-
dition. Pretrip orientations should include proper
fitting of helmets and life jackets, and what to do if
knocked overboard or the raft flips. Overnight trips
should include additional safety instruction relative
to camping, communication, and first aid.
• Guide training. Some states closely regulate the
rafting industry and require specific guide train-
ing programs that result in licenses. Other states
simply require rafting services to post a fee. There-
fore, phrases such as “state approved” or “trained
guides” will have different meanings in different
locations. Reliable operators should gladly share
details of their guide training programs with prospec-
tive clients. Many do so on their websites. Check
first-aid training and emergency action plans as well
as rafting credentials.
• Instructional programs. Some operators include
natural history and ecology programs in sections of
river between rapids. Many operate under permits
that require ecological responsibility.
• Alcohol policy. Most serious whitewater enthu-
siasts agree that alcohol and other drugs are not
conducive to whitewater performance or safety.
However, a few groups see float trips as opportu-
nities for binging, and some whitewater guides are
known to indulge heavily when off the river. Even
though Scouting trips should be alcohol-free, check
a rafting company’s policy on alcohol use by par-
ticipants and guides, particularly for overnight trips.
Some limit alcohol to an evening meal; others restrict
alcohol consumption to a post-trip party. Look for a
company that enforces a policy of restraint.
Commercial rafting services are not solely of interest to
those without whitewater skills. Access to some rivers
is by permit only, which may take years to obtain. Com-
mercial rafting operators may have access to permits
through other avenues, which means a trip down some
popular rivers is best arranged through an outfitter. Some
will escort kayaks with support rafts.

BSA High-Adventure Bases
Local council camps recognized by the BSA National Council offer an additional avenue
for a BSA unit to undertake a whitewater excursion under proper supervision. Check
www.scouting.org for a list of high-adventure bases and search for those that offer
river canoeing, kayaking, and rafting.
Additional insights on river and whitewater features may be gained from the Reading the Rhythms of Rivers and Rapids
DVD, a joint production of the ACA and the BSA, funded by a U.S. Coast Guard–administered grant. Each council should
have copies.

Float Trip Preparation
“Where to go?” seems a logical first concern when considering a float trip, but several interrelated questions must
be addressed together before the “where” can be finalized. Those questions include:
• Who will go?
• How long?
• What gear is needed?
• How is the gear obtained?
• How much will it cost?
• How to get there?
Chapter
21


Chapter 21: Float Trip Preparation226
Because a trip is often triggered by a suggested location,
we’ll start there, and see how the other questions arise.
Researching a Location
Inexperienced parties should only consider trips accom-
panied by a leader who knows the route from firsthand
knowledge. Ideally, a group will gain competence on
short day trips before tackling an extended wilderness
adventure. However, a skilled leader can guide inex-
perienced parties with adequate preparation. A group
of older Scouts strong on camping but weak in canoe-
ing can nevertheless enjoy the experience of a lifetime
under the wing of an interpreter at the Northern Tier High
Adventure Bases. “Where?” therefore depends on the
experience of the leaders and the skills of the partici-
pants, that is, the “Who?”
More-experienced groups can use river guidebooks
to review potential destinations. Many guidebooks are
rather obscure publications; the internet can be used to
track down a written or online guide to a particular river.
Do a search on a location by name or check the websites
of the major paddle sports organizations, of paddle clubs
near the location, and of government agencies that regu-
late certain lakes and rivers. Sporting goods stores may
carry printed guides for local destinations.
Guidebooks should provide maps and detailed informa-
tion on required permits, put-in and takeout points, camp-
sites, boat liveries, location and classification of rapids,
and recommended water levels based on local gauges.
Sometimes a phone number will be given for learning the
current gauge level. Restrictions on group size, the type
of food containers, fire options, and human waste dis-
posal should be noted in the guide.
While guidebooks can offer a wealth of useful informa-
tion, don’t forget that rivers change and that one person’s
Class II is another person’s Class III. Check the guide’s
publication date and use other sources, such as phone
numbers provided in the guide, to make sure the infor-
mation is still accurate. The location that once was a
freely used campsite may have changed hands, and
the new owner may expect a fee or prosecute campers
for trespassing. For lakes and rivers on public property,
check with park or ranger personnel. For lakes and riv-
ers bordered by private land, don’t assume you can camp
anywhere without prior permission. Campsites may be
limited to canoe liveries and state parks that will charge
a fee and may require reservations.


Chapter 21: Float Trip Preparation 227
Who to Take Where
Recall that Safety Afloat guidelines do not permit Cub
Scout or Webelos dens to conduct float trips.
Any youth operating a canoe or kayak must have passed
the BSA swimmer classification test. Although there are
special allowances for nonswimmers and beginners to
ride as passengers under limited conditions, a unit with
many members lacking swimming skills should concen-
trate on learn-to-swim opportunities rather than float trips.
Safety Afloat requires participants for trips on flat water
and moving water below Class III to demonstrate basic
skill proficiency. Ideally, skill instruction is provided
before a float trip, but time may be set aside at the begin-
ning of a trip for basic skill review. Travel distances
the first day should be adjusted accordingly. If a group
arrives at the put-in point at midday, then an overnight
stay at the launch area allows for skill review in the after-
noon, followed by an early start the next day. The unit
leader needs to use sound judgment when considering
such options. It may be reasonable to allow time at the
beginning of a short trip to check out a new member who
claims to have experience. In a pinch, such a person can
ride in a boat with a skilled leader. It is not appropriate to
attempt basic instruction at the start of a long, remote trip
when every member of the crew is a novice.
On rivers with rapids above Class II, there are three options:
(1) a group with basic skills may portage an occasional
Class III rapid; (2) those with advanced whitewater training
may run rapids rated at Class III or above, provided they
are confident in their ability to do so after scouting each
rapid; and (3) a novice group may ride in rafts (or dories)
under the direction of a professional guide in each craft.
That last option means that trip planning involves selecting
a rafting company as discussed in Chapter 20.
All things considered, Safety Afloat guidelines require
unit leaders to only consider float trips consistent with
the skill levels of unit members, both youth and adults.
That might limit a large troop to conducting special high-
adventure trips only for older, more skilled members. A
Venturing crew whose activity interest survey focuses
on whitewater canoeing may set a goal of a trip down a
local whitewater river. However, the crew may need to
plan training sessions and intermediate trips to accom-
plish that goal.
How Far in How Long?
River guidebooks are likely to give mileages between
takeout points but may not provide typical times needed
to make a run. That’s because “typical” depends on many
factors, such as the water level; how often and how long
the party stops to rest, eat, play, explore, or scout; and
the physical conditioning of the party. A Venturing crew
practicing for a marathon race might cover 20 miles in a
day, but five to 10 miles is more “typical” for a day trip,
depending on how much time is needed to get to the
launch point and make any necessary shuttles to get
home before dark.
The best way to judge the time needed to cover a given
stretch of lake or river is to make a conservative estimate
based on previous experience with a similar group under
similar conditions. Given a choice of a takeout point that
is a little short compared with the next one that is twice
the distance, choose the shorter distance. That way, the
group can take time to enjoy the trip rather than racing
against dusk while fighting a strong headwind. Livery
companies on popular rivers will be able to provide rea-
sonable estimates of travel time for a given flow level.
For an overnight trip on a weekend, you may need to
choose among several popular river segments even
though the group would like to do more. Make sure to fac-
tor in driving time. If you rent boats from a livery company,
the livery’s location may dictate your put-in and takeout
points. They may prefer you start or end at their location
to reduce the number of shuttles. Alternately, you may be
able to launch upstream one day, camp overnight at the
company’s campground, and continue the next day to a
takeout point.
For an extended trip on the water, it is prudent to
schedule a short leg or a layover midway through the
trip, ideally at a spot where there is something else to do
rather than paddle.


Chapter 21: Float Trip Preparation228
Gear: What, From Where,
at What Price
At a minimum, any float trip will require boats, life jackets,
and paddles. Overnight trips will also require standard
camping gear and provisions. Detailed lists are needed
later in the planning stage, but the source of boats is a
major consideration when first deciding on a location.
A unit with its own boats and boat transport has the great-
est flexibility in choosing a location. Some boat livery
companies rent boats only for their local stretch of lake
or river, but others will rent boats and trailers you can
take to various locations within their region. Using a local
livery company is advantageous when they transport the
boats for you. Otherwise, arranging your own shuttle can
take time away from the water. Many boat liveries sup-
ply only the necessary marine equipment. Others are total
outfitters equipped to provide food, tents, and cooking
stoves in addition to boats. Although contracting with a
complete outfitter simplifies the planning, it also ups the
cost. A typical unit may find a better fit to their budget if
they rent canoes from their council camp, buy their own
provisions, and use their own camping gear.
Note: Even though you have made reservations for boats
for a certain time, rental companies, including local
councils, may void the agreement at the last minute if
a river is up due to heavy rains the day before. That’s a
prudent business decision on their part and it also speaks
to your safety. The best-laid schemes “gang aft a-gley” and
need contingencies.
How to Get There: People,
Boats, and Shuttles
Buses are handy for large groups with gear traveling over
long distances without boats, and commercial carriers are
recommended. Many groups arrive that way at the Northern
Tier bases. If a unit uses its own or a rental bus, the drivers
must have the appropriate driving licenses. Smaller groups
may travel in rented vans or private automobiles.
The best way to transport canoes or kayaks is on a trailer
designed for that use. Make sure the boats are securely
fastened with straps, bungee cords, or lines. Such trail-
ers often have lockers for life jackets and paddles. If not,
those are packed in the tow vehicle. Make sure that the
tow vehicle and hitch are rated for the trailer and that
the trailer meets all legal requirements such as lights,
license, and safety chains. You should carry a spare tire
for the trailer and an appropriate jack.
It is also feasible to car-top canoes or kayaks for a small
group. Pipe racks on pickups can often be used as is, but
standard luggage racks on vans and SUVs are seldom
designed for hauling boats, particularly two canoes side
by side. You may be able to order special attachments
from a dealer. Alternately, removable racks can be pur-
chased. Some less-expensive models are generic and
can be adjusted to fit many vehicles. Higher-end racks
are tailored to fit specific automobiles. It is important to
obtain a good-quality rack that is held securely to the
vehicle. At highway speeds, the wind resistance on the
boats creates large forces. Foam blocks and other tem-
porary arrangements may be sufficient for transporting
a new boat slowly from the store to a garage, but are not
recommended for long distances at highway speeds.
The boats should be balanced on two racks that extend
across the top of the automobile. If necessary, adjust the
racks so that the end of the boat toward the front of the
car is level or slightly down. The wind needs to part along
the sides of the boat, not catch it from beneath. Canoes


Chapter 21: Float Trip Preparation 229
are loaded upside down; kayaks may be loaded either
way, based on design. Some kayak racks have J attach-
ments that rest kayaks on their sides. Secure the boat
or boats to the racks using cam straps, bungee cords,
or lines using a trucker’s hitch. The lines should be tight
and secure, but be careful: it is possible to tighten hard
enough to damage the hull.
The lines across the racks keep the boats from sliding
sideways and also help hold the boats down against
aerodynamic lift. However, all but the shortest boats also
need lines front and back for adequate security. Use rope
or straps for these, not bungee cords. Ideally, the fore
and aft lines should slant in opposite directions to hold
the boats in place not only against the wind while moving
forward, but also against sliding forward when braking.
Tie either the middle of a single line or two separate
lines to a secure attachment near the forward end of the
boat, normally where you would tie a painter to a canoe
or to the grab loop on a kayak. Angle the lines down to
the front of the vehicle to form a V. Old-fashioned metal
bumpers offered several attachment options that are not
available on newer plastic bumpers. Attach the ends of
the lines to tow hooks or other secure spots on the frame
beneath the bumper. Avoid sharp edges or moving parts.
Alternately, you may be able to attach tie loops under the
hood and still be able to shut the hood securely. Pull the
lines snug, but not too tight, with trucker’s hitches. Cut
or secure loose ends to keep them from flapping against
the car finish or getting caught in moving parts. Make
another V in back.
On lakes, it is common to plan a circular trip that ends where
it began. On rivers, it is common for the starting point to be
upstream of the takeout. That difference requires a shuttle
to get land transport from one location to the other. There
are two easy ways to do it: (1) pay a reliable outside party to
run the shuttle, e.g., a livery that includes a shuttle service
as part of the package; or (2) have extra adults along willing
to follow the party by road. Other options need careful plan-
ning and may involve several trips along the same road to
reconnect gear, people, and vehicles. Do not leave the
shuttle to chance. Hitchhiking is dangerous and unreli-
able, and transportation at the takeout is useful in case of
an emergency.
A shuttle requires at least two vehicles. Dropping a vehicle
at the takeout on the way to the put-in is a good option if the
entire party and all the gear fit in the remaining vehicles. At
the end of the trip, the majority of the party waits at the take-
out while the drivers are taken to the start and then return.
Make sure there are enough leaders to maintain adequate
supervision and to satisfy Youth Protection policies for both
groups whenever the party is split.


Chapter 21: Float Trip Preparation230
If all the vehicles are needed to transport people and
gear, then the entire party goes to the put-in and unloads.
Then two vehicles are driven to the takeout. One vehicle
is left and both drivers return. When the party leaves the
river, a double trip is required again.
For extended river trips, a round-trip shuttle may take
several hours, particularly if there is no direct road
between the put-in and takeout. It the party does not
reach the put-in or takeout early in the day, an overnight
camp may be necessary. In remote areas, make sure to
maintain sufficiently full gas tanks to complete the legs.
On many rivers, common access sites are on public
rights-of-way at bridge crossings, so shuttle vehicles are
often left near bridges or low-water crossings. Although
that practice is fairly common among river runners, it
does risk the vehicle to theft and vandalism. A safer bet
is to launch and land at established campgrounds. If a
vehicle is left near a bridge, make sure it is above the
high-water mark. Some folks are fearful of losing car keys
on the river and will hide the keys near the vehicle, but
you never know who is watching. It makes better sense
to carry two sets of keys downriver in separate boats.
Float Plan
Once the waterway segment is decided on and other
details considered, such as how to run the shuttle, it’s time
to plan a detailed itinerary. Folks who have run the river
before are valuable resources. If you don’t have such a
person in your party, see if there is someone else around
willing to offer advice based on personal knowledge.
Good maps make planning the itinerary easier. River maps in
guidebooks or off the internet may be only sketches. Highway
maps are typically at too large a scale to show useful back
roads and don’t reliably track all the bends in the river. County
road maps are good for the back roads, and topographic


Chapter 21: Float Trip Preparation 231
maps help spot campsites and emergency exit routes. In lake
country, try to find a map that shows portage trails. For sea
kayaking along the coasts, get charts for the water and maps
for the land. Maps and charts in GPS navigation systems may
or may not have the needed detail depending on the location
and the data loaded.
The itinerary is part of the float plan, along with emergency
contact information and contingencies. Refer to the
sample form.
What to Take
What to take depends on the location, the duration, and
the time of year. The following lists provide reasonable
guidelines, but temper them with local knowledge and
common sense. Camping from a boat is not that differ-
ent from camping on a backpacking trip. For some trips
you will need a heavy-duty sleeping bag; for others, a
lightweight bag will suffice. In some areas, you may be
concerned with bears; in other areas it may be alligators.
Although gear capacity is limited in some kayaks, canoes
and touring kayaks generally make it easier to carry more
gear than on a backpacking trip. Even so, take enough to
be comfortable, but don’t pack gear you will never touch.
Always follow Leave No Trace principles. Check the BSA
Fieldbook for information on camping and the Leave No
Trace program.

How to Pack
The challenge when packing for a float trip is to keep
things dry. Water easily finds its way into any opening.
For a short day trip, a 5-gallon plastic paint bucket with a
sealing lid, available empty at discount outlets, makes a
reasonable container. It has enough space for lunch and
essentials, and is light, waterproof, and inexpensive. If
you like, take off the handle and thread a light line
through the hinge for tying to a thwart. If the canoe
capsizes, the bucket can be cast free—it will float with a
reasonable load.
A bucket, or any other secure container, is difficult to open
and close quickly while under way. Waterproof items you
need often, such as sunscreen, are better kept in a simple
fanny pack that can be tied to a thwart. An underwater
camera housing is useful if you want to take snapshots
without jeopardizing an expensive mechanism. Some
digital cameras have enough water resistance to shake
off an occasional splash with no ill effect.
For overnight excursions you can use conventional
packs, either with or without a frame. Cook pots need
no additional protection, but food, clothes, and sleeping
bags do. Individually bag items in zip-lock or heavy-duty
plastic garage bags, and then place those within a larger
bag. Leave enough room to make a twisted, fold-over
gooseneck that can be secured with rubber bands. Make
sure to carry plenty of folded spare bags and rubber
bands since rips are common. Pack food in clear bags so
contents are visible after the outer bag is opened.
You can also purchase special gear bags with various
waterproof, or near-waterproof, closing mechanisms, but
double layering is still useful for critical items. Special
containers fit the spaces beneath kayak hatches easier
than generic backpacks will fit.
Once the gear is secured in waterproof containers,
place the items in the boat. In a canoe, place the gear
on the bottom in the center. Balance the load so that the
canoe, paddlers included, stays in trim both sideways
and fore and aft. Tie the gear in, particularly any item
that doesn’t float well, so it is not lost during a capsize.
Gear secured well will displace water in a swamped
canoe and help float the boat higher. On the other hand,
a complicated tie-in system can make it more difficult to
empty a swamped canoe.


Chapter 21: Float Trip Preparation 233
A cruising canoe can hold an amazing amount of gear,
as shown in the photo on a previous page. Like to cook
in a Dutch oven? There’s plenty of room to carry one.
However, if your trip involves reaching your destination
by float plane, portaging from lake to lake, or moving gear
on steep, rough trails around rapids, keep the number and
weight of the items small enough that everything can be
carried in one trip.
On a backpacking trip, hikers typically carry individual
packs. On a canoe trip, it often makes sense to share a
pack. That allows one person to portage gear while the
other carries the canoe. Split critical group supplies,
such as food, between boats. If a boat is lost, including
its share of the gear, the group should still be able to con-
tinue, although on a shorter schedule, perhaps.
On the Water
Planning needs to include procedures used on the water.
Buddies in tandem boats should be matched according
to size and skill as well as compatibility. Size is a consid-
eration for proper trim. Pairing those with lesser skill with
more experienced paddlers will keep the group moving
efficiently while providing valuable training. Buddy boat
assignments for solo craft should also pair experienced
paddlers with novices. However, make sure the lead and
sweep boats have experienced crews. It is particularly
important to have someone familiar with the route in the
lead boat. A missed portage trail or scouting location
could lead the following boats into hazards.
If possible, plan a route that follows the shoreline rather
than striking long distances across open water. If a long-
distance, open-water segment is desired, for example to
reach an island campground, review local and approaching
weather patterns before leaving shore. Either wait or take
a contingency route if facing strong winds, high waves, or
strong currents. Be leery of leaving a shoreline with the
wind at your back. While such a wind will help push you in
the desired direction, it may also cause increased offshore
wave action that makes the path ahead hazardous and the
return path to safety increasingly difficult.
When planning a long trip with several portages, try to
arrange the route so that longer portages come after the
group becomes conditioned on shorter runs. Plus, the weight
of food decreases as the trip progresses. Make sure to allow
extra time in the itinerary for long or difficult portages.
When stopping at a campsite, make sure to secure all
boats against changes in wind or water levels during the
night. Normally, that means bringing them completely
ashore. Minimalist campers may use the canoe itself as
a shelter. An overturned canoe balanced on rocks serves
as a makeshift table for food preparation.

Rowing
Traditionally, oars were the primary motive power for small craft for a wide range of commercial and recreational activi-
ties such as fishing, ferrying, bird hunting, and tending larger vessels. The advent of small outboard motors has almost
made rowing a lost art today. Basic rowing skills are still advantageous, however, in several situations. Many youth are
attracted to rowing as a fun activity because they are interested in boats of all kinds.
Chapter
22


Chapter 22: Rowing236
Sliding-Seat (Competitive) Rowing. Competitive rowing
is gaining popularity as more schools and clubs sponsor
teams. A local rowing club could provide resources for a
Venturing crew to specialize in the activity. Sliding-seat
rowing provides excellent whole-body aerobic exercise,
and there is joy in how easily a long, slender craft glides
through the water. However, most such craft are not well
suited for anything beyond rowing in a straight line on
calm water. Only a few sliding-seat designs are available
for transporting people and gear on trips. They are not
useful as tenders or for fishing and such.
River Dories. Dories are used on several western rivers
for running whitewater and drift fishing. Running rapids in
any craft requires specialized skills. Youth groups should
normally ride as passengers in such craft with the rowing
done by an experienced guide.
River Rafting. River rafting was mentioned briefly in Chap-
ter 20 as a means by which youth groups without special-
ized skills can experience white water. Oared rafts are
also used as support craft for kayaking groups.
Conventional Rowing. Rowing is a useful skill when using
small boats as tenders to cruising sailboats, as guard craft
during unit swims, or to move quietly from one fishing
spot to another. Rowboats are suited for such purposes
due to their carrying capacity and stability, particularly
in waves. In some countries, properly designed and
equipped rowboats are offered for hire in public parks.
Boat Design
Although many excellent rowboat designs are still manu-
factured, those tend to be of limited production and expen-
sive. Most small craft outfitted with oars are actually
designed for small outboard motors. The back seat will
be positioned forward of the transom to allow space for a
fuel can and to allow better trim and tiller control. Oarlock
sockets may not be positioned correctly for easy rowing.
Compared to a dory or other classic design, the typical
small powerboat under oars may seem sluggish but will
generally perform well if the oars are correctly sized.


Chapter 22: Rowing 237
Oars
Probably the greatest impediment to easy rowing is
the tendency to use oars that are too short. Oars must
be sized to the boat, not the rower. That is, a Cub Scout
will find it harder to row a wide-beamed boat with short
oars than with long oars. Typically, oars need to be 7 to
8 feet or longer, but unfortunately the sporting-goods
departments of large chain stores will often only stock
6-foot oars. Therefore, you may need to special-order the
correct size oars for your boat. Be aware that price
increases with length.
Correctly sized oars resting in the oarlocks should float
with the blades in the water and the handles meeting
amidships at belly-button height of a person centered on
the seat. The correct oar length will increase with beam
width and freeboard height. If the oars are too short,
they will dig too deep in the water, pop out of the lock,
and force the rower to position the hands either too high
or too far apart for efficient rowing.
Buttons on oars are not essential but do help keep the
oars positioned, while the rower is reaching for a flotation
device to throw to a swimmer in distress, for example.
Oars with buttons typically also have sleeves or leathers
to protect the oar from wear on the oarlock. Traditionally,
buttons and sleeves were made from leather held in place
by stitching or tacks, but rubber and plastic versions are
available. The button should clear the lock when the oar
is in use.

Chapter 22: Rowing238
Oarlocks
The next key to effective rowing is a proper oarlock. Folks
attempting to row with oars that are too short tend to
favor locks, such as clamps and pins, that hold the oar
to the boat. An oar that is too short will tend to pop out of
an open-top oarlock. Open-top or ring locks are preferred
since they allow the oar to feather. Again, these may
be special-order or internet shopping items. The typical
sporting-goods department may stock only the inferior
styles, if any.
Davis (rowing position) Davis (safety position)
Open Ring
The socket for the lock should be located approximately
forearm or thigh length aft of a rower sitting upright on
the seat. The lock should be secured to the socket with
a chain or lanyard so that the lock can be lowered when
people are getting in and out of the boat. Alternately, a
ring lock may be left on the oar beneath the button, or a
self-contained Davis lock may be used.
Note that other styles of locks are used with sliding-seat
and raft rigs.

Moving Forward
Catch
Catch. Facing aft with blades clear of the water, lean
toward the stern with arms stretched forward. Drop the
blades into the water edgewise.
Pull
Pull. Brace your legs and sweep the blades aft by first
leaning back with arms straight, and then finish with
elbows next to your sides.
Feather
Feather. Rotate the blades almost flat to the water by
rolling the wrists down. Feathering prevents wind and
wave resistance during the recovery.
Recover
Recover. Return to the catch position by leaning forward
with the blades feathered just above the water (or
skipping across the surface if there aren’t any waves).


Chapter 22: Rowing240
Moving Backward
Catch. Angle the oars slightly aft by pulling your hands to
your belly with your elbows at your sides. Drop the blades
into the water edgewise.
Push. Lean aft and straighten your arms to sweep the
blades toward the bow. Finish with arms extended aft.
Feather. Rotate the blades almost flat to the water by
rolling the wrists up. (Your hands twist in the opposite
direction to the forward stroke.)
Recover. Pull back on the oars to return to the catch
position with the blades feathered just above the water
(or skipping across the surface if there aren’t any waves).


Chapter 22: Rowing 241
Stops, Turns, and Pivots
To stop, hold water with the blades submerged, or reverse
the stroke slightly.
To turn under way, pull harder on one oar than the other.
To pivot, or spin in place, row forward with one oar while
backing water with the other.
Pivot–catch
Pivot–push-pull
Pivot–feathering
Rowing Tips
Common errors can be avoided by imagining that you
slide your hands within a narrow, flat track or “groove.”
Keep the grips close together with your elbows down.
Having your hands too far apart reduces your leverage
against the oarlock. Minimize vertical movement to pre-
vent “windmilling.” If you push your hands down while
feathering, you waste energy lifting the blades too far out
of the water. If you raise your hands during the catch and
pull, the blades go too deep into the water and you are
likely to pop the oar out of the lock. Be careful during the
recovery to keep the leading edge of a feathered blade
tilted slightly up. Otherwise, the blade will dive into the
water if you try to skim the oars or catch a bit of wave
chop. The reaction of a diving blade, called “catching a
crab,” may be strong enough to knock you from your seat.
Additional tips on oar length, boat trim, maintaining
course, sculling, sliding-seat rowing, and other subjects
can be found in the Rowing merit badge pamphlet.


Chapter 22: Rowing242
Swimmer Assists
Rowboats used as guard craft at a unit swim should be
positioned at the perimeter of the swimmer area and
crewed by a buddy team equipped with rescue aids.
Distressed swimmers can be thrown a flotation aid as
the rower backs water to allow the person to grasp the
transom. A reach pole or an extra oar may be used as a
reaching device. Incapacitated swimmers are held at the
back of the boat by the coxswain as the rower moves the
boat quickly to shore. If the boat is a long distance from
safety—for example, guarding a snorkeling party near
a reef—the victim can be lifted over the stern of some
boats if rescue breathing/CPR is needed.
If rowboats are used to protect long-distance swimmers
in open water, such as for the Mile Swim, then BSA poli-
cies state that the swimmer is followed by a rowboat with
both a rower and a spotter.


Sailing
Sailing is a popular recreational activity that is fun, healthy, challenging, and not as expensive as one might assume.
Many of today’s youth are keenly interested in sailing but may have little access to boats and little opportunity to learn
sailing skills. Scouting programs address that gap and provide sailing opportunities in more than one format in boats
of various sizes. Some focus on the individual, others on the unit. This chapter addresses program opportunities rather
than specific sailing skills. Basic sailing skills are introduced in the Fieldbook and covered more thoroughly in the Small-
Boat Sailing merit badge pamphlet.
Chapter
23


Chapter 23: Sailing244
Small-Boat Programs
The Small-Boat Sailing merit
badge is designed primarily for
the individual Scout and their
buddy using small craft with
limited crew capability. Scouts
can earn the merit badge from
local counselors and at many
council summer camps.
Some Venturing crews, particularly Sea Scout ships, spe-
cialize in sailing as one of their primary activities. The fol-
lowing elements should be considered for such programs:
• Sailing for pleasure with competition only as an option
• Learning by doing
• Using youth members as counselors aided by
volunteer consultants
• Maximum time on the water with a minimum of lectures
• Visual aids and simple instructional materials to
support learning
• A series of sailing exercises and drills to add fun to
skills practice
• Competition with those of like ability with an emphasis
on fun rather than winning
Professionally Crewed Day Trips
Several large sailing vessels offer scheduled day trips for
the general public from various ports on the coasts and
the Great Lakes. These offer a fun introduction to large-
boat sailing to BSA members of all ages and abilities and
can accommodate large groups if prearrangements are
made for a block of tickets. However, the group will be
passengers with limited opportunities for learning skills.
Make sure the captain and the vessel have current U.S.
Coast Guard credentials.


Chapter 23: Sailing 245
Captained Charters
An active industry of large and small companies pro-
vides crewed boats for hire for typical terms of one to
two weeks. The crew may consist of only a captain or
include a mate/cook. Patrons can leave everything to the
crew or operate the vessel under supervision. Fees and
availability may vary by season. Summer is the prime sea-
son in northern waters around Maine and Vancouver. In
southern waters, particularly the Caribbean, summer is
the off season due to heat and potential hurricanes. Typi-
cally, group size is limited, around four to eight, but some
larger vessels are available. Catamarans may accommo-
date larger numbers than a monohull of the same length.
While there are many well-maintained boats with reputa-
ble captains willing to work with Scouting groups, there is
also the potential for a bad experience, particularly when
booking sight unseen months in advance. An easy way
for a unit leader to vet a boat and crew is to book the trip
through the BSA’s Florida National High Adventure Sea
Base or through several council high-adventure bases
that offer similar opportunities. A few vessels are avail-
able for groups of 20 or so.
Bareboat Charters
Boats may also be hired without a crew. That frees space
aboard for other unit members but also places greater
responsibility on the unit leader. Before renting boats,
charter companies generally require proof of sailing
competency. If you don’t qualify, some will provide a cap-
tain for an additional fee. You will need experience on larger
boats to qualify. One way to gain that experience is through
a keelboat training program. There are numerous sailing
schools affiliated with organizations such as US Sailing
or the American Sailing Association whose training pro-
grams are recognized, or required, by charter companies.
Information on sailing schools and charter companies may
be found in SAIL magazine and on the internet.
Many charter companies restrict sailing to daylight hours
within sight of land. Those are good guidelines for any
amateur skipper and crew.


Chapter 23: Sailing246
Cruising Checklist
Not all charter companies require the same experience,
and a unit may also have the opportunity to use a private
vessel on a local lake skippered by a member’s parent.
For a self-assessment, the following checklist of gear and
skills may be used. Details will vary depending on the type
of vessel and the cruising area, but a lack of comfort in
any pertinent area is a flag that needs additional review.
A similar list should be reviewed with a charter company
before accepting a vessel.
Rigging:
• Standing rigging (stays, shrouds, spreaders, life-
lines, etc.) in good condition and properly adjusted.
• Running rigging in good condition and understood.
Operation of every line, cleat, and winch is clear and
it is obvious how to:
– Raise, lower, and reef the main, including any
roller reefing or topping lift
– Raise, lower, or roller furl the jib, including
whether the furling system can be used to
reduce sail
• Ground tackle should include at least two anchors
and rodes.
Mechanical Systems:
• Rudder operation checked. Wheel has centerline
indicator.
• Swing keel operation reviewed.
• Operation and basic maintenance of the auxiliary
engine is clear (start, throttle, neutral, engaged).
• Engine compartment clean (to allow easy determi-
nation of new fuel, oil, or water leaks).
• Cooking system operation and safety precautions
reviewed.
• Fire extinguishers easily accessible for either
engine or cooking fires.
• Bilge pump operational; manual backup system
available.
• Freshwater system reviewed (capacity, pump opera-
tion, level indicator, cutoff valves, filling procedure).
• Fuel system reviewed (fuel type, capacity, level
indicator, cutoff valves, filling procedure).
• Head and shower operation reviewed, including
holding-tank capacity and emptying.
• Dinghy checked (towing or storage system, outboard
operation and maintenance, repair kit for inflatable).
Electrical/Electronic Systems:
• Is generator attached to auxiliary engine or
separate?
• Battery system reviewed (charging procedure,
bank usage, and switching).
• Shore power connections reviewed.
• Navigation and interior lighting system reviewed.
• Marine radio operation and procedures checked.
• Is there a system for weather forecasts?
• Depth-finder operation and alarm setting.
Lead-line backup.


Chapter 23: Sailing 247
Mal de mer
The constant motion aboard a boat can unsettle
the stomach and produce nausea or worse. Those
who have problems with motion sickness in cars
should seek medical advice before a sailboat
cruise. Prescription medications are available.
Over-the-counter pills may work for some suffer-
ers. Just about anyone will show signs of seasick-
ness if below deck in a hot, confined space when
the boat is pushing through swells while heeling.
Anyone green behind the gills should stay on deck
in the fresh air with a view of the horizon. A turn at
the wheel or another task may help. Hopefully, the
feeling will soon pass. However, anyone stricken
with severe motion sickness should be monitored
for dehydration.
Navigation Aids:
• Chart plotters up-to-date with clearly understood
operation?
• Backup paper charts and magnetic compasses
available?
• Binoculars supplied?
• Is there a local cruising guide with information on
channels, anchorages, etc.?
Accommodations and Provisioning:
• Adequate sleeping space for all aboard, consistent
with Youth Protection policies?
• List of personal gear provided to each unit member?
• Is food provided by the charter company, by the unit,
or a combination?
• Are any perishable food items properly stored
(icebox or refrigeration)?
Maneuvers
Is the skipper confident that supervised crew members can:
• Set and trim sails for all points of sail (tack, reach,
and run).
• Come about.
• Plot a course to the next waypoint.
• Read channel markers.
• Follow rules-of-the-road when encountering
other vessels.
• Quickly recover a person who falls overboard while
under way.
• Quickly de-power, lower, and/or furl sails.
• Anchor, moor, or dock under power in potentially
crowded anchorages.
• Anchor, moor, or dock under sail if auxiliary
power fails.
• Manage adequately if skipper becomes incapacitated.


Chapter 23: Sailing248
Float Plan:
The charter company should provide advice on:
• Local sights and activities, such as a good
snorkeling location.
• Local regulations (e.g., fishing licenses)
and customs.
• Good and bad anchorages.
• Tricky channels.
• Good restaurants for a treat and places to avoid
crowds.
• Provisioning locations.
• Who to contact, where, and how, for minor and
major emergencies.
Emergencies:
Discuss with the charter company:
• Major medical emergencies.
• Minor medical concerns (should have a first-aid kit
adequate for removing fishhooks, etc.).
• Major vessel damage.
• Theft or other criminal activities.
• Running aground.
• Location and use of flares and other emergency gear.
Although basic sailing procedures are universal, different
boats have different systems and will handle differently.
The above checklist is for guidance only and does not sub-
stitute for experience. Nothing beats a short shakedown
on the actual vessel or a sister ship. Someone confident
in tight maneuvering of a 25-footer may still be intimidated
the first time at the wheel of a 45-footer. Don’t hesitate to
inform the charter company of such concerns. They may
offer to have, or insist on having, a representative aboard
for a short time while you get the feel of the boat.
NOTE: Because most cruising sailboats have auxiliary
power, skippers must also comply with all rules
applicable to motorboats. Chapter 25 on motorboating
provides additional guidance.


Boardsailing
In 1969, Americans Jim Drake and Hoyle Schweitzer combined sailing and surfing and founded a new aquatics sport.
Windsurfing is the popular expression used to describe the use of a sailboard, but that term was initially trademarked.
Boardsailing was the generic alternative used when the activity became a full Olympic sport in 1988. Boardsailing is
fun, relatively inexpensive compared with some sports, and great exercise.
Sailboards can reach speeds of 40 mph, ride huge waves, and even go airborne. When learn-
ing, it is very important to select the right equipment to learn the basics. An experienced
instructor will make the effort much easier. US Sailing (www.ussailing.org) and US Windsurfing
(www.uswindsurfing.org) provide information on courses and online tutorials. Some Scout
summer camps offer boardsailing programs, and your local council may have a list of Board-
sailing BSA counselors. A Boardsailing BSA award application is provided in Appendix 3.
Chapter
24


Chapter 24: Boardsailing250
The Board
Learning is easier with a board that has good stability and
buoyancy. Therefore, start with a wide board with a large
volume. Avoid short advanced shapes with a narrow nose
and tail until you have mastered the basics.
Less expensive boards made of molded polyethylene are
tough but are heavier than more expensive boards made
of various composites such as fiberglass, Kevlar, and car-
bon fiber.
The nose or bow at the front of the board is shaped to ride
over small waves without diving.
The tail or stern always remains in the water. A wide tail
provides increased stability that allows you to move back
on the board.
A small fin or skeg is attached on the underside of the tail
to help tracking. Without it, the board would spin in circles.
A mast track or foot on the top of the board near the cen-
ter holds the sailing rig to the board.
Just aft of the mast track, most boards have a second,
larger fin that helps the board point closer to the wind, the
same as a daggerboard or centerboard on other sailing
craft. There may be a lever handle on top of the board that
pivots the blade up and down.
The tops of all boards should have a nonslip coating to
allow you to stand on the board without slipping.
Many boards will have foot straps positioned aft on each
side of the board. Foot straps are not needed for basic
maneuvers and should not be used by beginners.

The Rig
The rig consists of the sail and the spars that hold it in place.
The front edge of the sail is the luff, the back edge is the
leach, and the bottom is the foot.
The mast is a rigid tube of metal or composite material
that slides into a sleeve along the luff of the sail.
The mast foot at the bottom of the mast has a universal
joint that attaches to the board’s mast track. The attach-
ment allows the rig to pivot in any direction.
A safety leash provides a backup connection to the board
in case the mast foot fails. A rig attached to the board
makes it less likely to blow away from a sailor dumped in
the water.
The back of the sail is held away from the mast with a
divided wishbone boom usually made of aluminum. The
boom attaches to the mast with an adjustable clamp in a
cutout in the luff sleeve. The boom is used to control the
sail and has a textured grip on both sides of the sail. For
best results, the boom should be positioned on the mast
between shoulder and chin height.
The back corner of the sail, or clew, attaches to the back
of the boom with a line called the outhaul. The bottom of
the sail at the luff is the tack and is attached to the mast
with another line called the downhaul.


Chapter 24: Boardsailing252
The sail functions best when the downhaul and outhaul
are properly tensioned to produce a smooth airfoil. Flex-
ible battens running across the width of the sail help
maintain the shape. Pulleys are used to gain sufficient
tension in the downhaul to flatten the sail along the luff.
The clew is tensioned sufficiently to keep the sail off the
boom. Once pulled taut, the lines are held in place with
various types of cleats.
The uphaul is a line attached to the boom that is used to
pull the rig from the water into a sailing position.
If you buy a rig, it should come with rigging instructions,
but the novice using a camp or rental board should rely
on an instructor to provide guidance. For best results, the
fullness of the sail can be adjusted, or tuned, based on
wind conditions.
Sail designs vary with use. Racing sails are large, with a
tall luff, a long boom, and a low foot. Wave sails used in
the surf have a shorter luff and boom and a higher foot.
Generally, beginners should start out with smaller sails.
A sail that is too big for the wind conditions is difficult to
control and tiring to use.

Moving to the Water
Initially you can rely on your instructor, but eventually you
will need to learn how to rig the sail and move it and the
board to the water, and attach the rig to the board. The
illustrations provide pointers.
Before you start to sail, for the first time or the umpteenth,
make sure your gear is ready: Double-check your life
jacket and the rig, particularly the mast foot attachment.
Also check the weather and surroundings. Begin-
ners should start in light winds (3 to 7 knots) and calm,
uncrowded water. Do not launch into winds that are
blowing offshore into large expanses of water.
Carry the rig either at your side
or above your head with the mast
toward the wind.
Carry the board at your side, with one hand on the
centerboard and the other on the mast track. Avoid
turning broadside to the wind.


Chapter 24: Boardsailing254
Uphauling
Start with the board sideways to the wind with the rig on
the downwind side. Face the board with your back to the
wind and one hand on each side of the mast.
Boost yourself into a kneeling position over the center of
the board. When stable, crouch with your feet on either
side of the mast along the centerline of the board, grasp
the uphaul, and carefully stand up.
Keep your back and arms straight, with your head up.
Push up with your legs and lean back to slowly slide the
rig from the water.
Finish pulling the rig from the water until you can grasp
the mast with both hands just below the boom. Don’t pull
the mast completely vertical. Your body and the mast
should form a V. Your back should still be to the wind with
the sail flapping, or luffing, loosely downwind. Your front
foot should be against the mast foot, and your back foot
should be on the centerline behind the mast about shoul-
der width from your front foot. This is the basic position.
From the basic position, you can pause by lowering the
rig, turn the board, or move to a sailing position. If the
board starts to turn, the rig is leaning either too far for-
ward or aft. Tilting the rig in one direction will cause the
board to rotate in the other direction.

Chapter 24: Boardsailing 255
Getting Under Way
Experienced sailors move seamlessly into a sailing position
during the uphaul by grasping the boom near the mast with
their forward hand while adjusting their stance. The boom
is then grasped with the back hand and pulled in to catch
the wind. The actions are firm, but the body is relaxed.
The beginner may wish to start with a more deliberate
progression. From the basic position, release the mast
with your back hand. Step aft with your back foot across
the centerline and your front foot angled forward just
behind the mast. That rotates your body toward the front
of the board and allows you to look forward.
Shift the rig to maintain balance. The sail should still be
luffing with the rig tilted downwind.
Next, place both hands on the boom about shoulder-width
apart with your hands on top. Your forward hand will be
slightly aft of the mast. Pull the boom in with your back
hand by rotating your rear shoulder away from the rig. The
sail will catch the wind and the board will move forward.
With the wind from the side, pulling in on the boom will
increase the force on the sail. Letting out will decrease
the force. Let go with your back hand to luff the sail if you
start to lose control.
Stay relaxed and lean back gently against the pull of the
sail. Keep your body and arms straight in the shape of the
number 7. Look ahead.
As the board accelerates, you may need to make slight
adjustments to your stance or where you grasp the boom
to maintain comfortable control and trim. Experiment with
different positions in a light breeze. Some boards will be
more forgiving than others.
Signs of poor positioning include: shoulders in with hips
out, feet across the board, bent arms, arms too far apart,
and head facing the sail near the rig.

Chapter 24: Boardsailing256
Steering
Since a sailboard has no rudder, steering is done by shifting
the rig. When the wind strikes the sail at an angle, part of
the force moves the board forward while part of the force
tries to move the board sideways. Both force components
act as if they were applied at a single point on the sail called
the center of effort (CE). The sideways, or lateral, force is
countered by the resistance of the water on the fins. The
water resistance acts at a point called the center of lateral
resistance (CLR). When the CE and CLR are directly above
one another, there is a tendency for the board to heel that
is countered by the sailor leaning to windward. However,
the lateral forces are balanced and the board moves for-
ward in a fixed direction. Tilting the rig forward shifts the
CE ahead of the CLR, and the resulting moment of unbal-
anced forces causes the front of the board to turn with the
wind. Tilting the rig aft shifts the CE behind the CLR, and the
front of the board turns into the wind.


Chapter 24: Boardsailing 257
Turning Around
There are three different procedures for making major
course changes or reversing direction. The board may
be tacked by turning into the wind while under way. The
sailor moves from one side of the board to the other by
stepping around the front of the mast. Tacking is used to
beat upwind and may also be used for reversing direc-
tion. Tacking is described in the next section.
Jibing is turning downwind while under way. The sail is flipped
from one side to the other around the front of the board. Jibing
is more difficult than tacking and will not be illustrated here
because it is not required for Boardsailing BSA.
The third procedure is done from the basic position with
the sail luffed. The rig is tilted forward and the board
rotated beneath it. This procedure should be learned
during your first sessions on the board—it is vital that
you know how to return to your starting point. The tech-
nique is also useful for aligning the board in the direction
of desired travel when you launch. You will not always
desire or be able to proceed perpendicular to the wind as
the getting under way sequence assumed.
To start the turn, luff the sail to cut power. After the board
slows, grasp the mast or the uphaul with both hands.
Then shift the rig so that it points toward the bow (actu-
ally, the board rotates under the rig).
As the board turns, keep one foot on each side of the mast
and take small steps to turn the board as you continue to
face the mast.
Once the board is pointing in the desired direction, return
to the sailing position and adjust the boom for power.


Chapter 24: Boardsailing258
Tacking
To turn without stopping, turn the board toward the wind.
Grasp the mast with your front hand, lean the sail aft, and
step forward across the board with your front foot.

As the board turns through the wind, grasp the mast with
both hands and step forward with the back foot to face
the rig. Twist around the rig on the balls of your feet, bring
the mast upright, step back, grasp the boom, and resume
a sailing position on the new side.


Chapter 24: Boardsailing 259
Points of Sail
The angle of the sail to the wind and the board depends
on the heading relative to the wind. The board cannot
travel directly into the wind. With the boom pulled parallel
to the board, sheeted in, turn into the wind until the board
starts to slow down or stall, then back off slightly. That’s
as tight to the wind as the board will go, which is often
near 45 degrees. Traveling into the wind, called beating,
will require a series of zigzag tacks.
To sail off the wind, or reach, let the sail out to maximize
speed and minimize tilt. A beam reach is faster than the
wind. The board is perpendicular to the wind with the sail
out near 45 degrees.
To go directly downwind, or run, the sail is at 90 degrees
to the board and you should be centered on the board,
facing forward, with your back to the wind. Adjust your
stance to balance the board, which may feel wobbly or
unstable in this direction. The board can go no faster than
the wind in this direction.

Stopping
As you near the shore, sheet out to slow down, and then
let the rig luff as you coast the final distance. Carefully
lower the rig into the water, which will stop any remaining
forward motion. Crouch down as you lower the sail, and
then step off the board.
Emergencies
Even when you are careful, situations can arise that will
require assistance. For example, a part of the rig could
break. Since you should always sail with a buddy close
at hand, such assistance should be easy to summon. One
way to attract attention is to use a whistle. Always sail with
a whistle attached to your life jacket. Another option is to
flap your arms vertically in the international distress signal.
Falling off the board is an inevitable part of learning. Try
not to fall headfirst, and try not to land on the board or
the rig. Avoid foot entrapment between the mast and the
board near the mast track. Raise your arms to protect
your head from a falling rig. Always stay with the board.
If the rig separates from the board, grasp the board first.
If you can’t sail back to shore—for example, the rig or fin
is broken, the wind has stopped completely, or the wind
has strengthened beyond your comfort level—the prudent
action is to signal for a rescue boat. For short distances, you
can paddle to shore by lying prone along the board. Your
buddy should follow close by. In light winds, balance the
wishbone boom on the aft portion of the board to lift the sail
clear of the water. Then lie prone on the forward portion of
the board and paddle to shore. In heavier winds, dismantle
the rig and roll the sail to make it easier to paddle or to take
gear aboard a rescue boat. If you are paddling to shore,
point upwind or upcurrent of your projected landing site.


Chapter 24: Boardsailing 261
Be alert for other watercraft. With the rig down, the board
may be difficult for others to see. (Yet another reason for
a buddy board close by.)
Know the Environment
Sailing conditions vary with wind speed, the body of water,
and other boat traffic. A small lake or a calm, enclosed
bay free of other boats is an ideal area for learning. In
such a setting, you should be able to reach shore along
some direction even if you can’t return to your launch site.
On large lakes or an ocean shoreline, beginners should
not launch into an offshore wind. Stay close to shore in
case the wind shifts direction or dies. In some areas, the
wind will shift from offshore in the morning to onshore
in the afternoon and die in the late afternoon. In other
areas, afternoon thunderstorms are common during
certain seasons. Get off the water in advance of thunder
and lightning.
Be alert for shallow water and areas with underwater
obstructions. In some parts of the country, trees are left
upright in lakes formed by dams and may present under-
water hazards.
Tidal currents are strong in some coastal areas, particu-
larly in bays and in the channels between barrier islands.
Currents may also be a factor in rivers large enough for
boardsailing. Do not sail in situations where currents can
carry you offshore or into areas of danger.
Beginners should avoid all but the smallest waves and
surf. Wave sailing and other extreme aspects of the sport
are only for the experts.
The environment also affects your physical comfort and
well-being. Drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration in
hot, humid conditions. Protect yourself against sunburn.
Be wary of hypothermia. Return to shore if you begin to
shiver. Wear shoes or booties to protect your feet.


Chapter 24: Boardsailing262
Safety Guidelines
Whenever Scouts or Venturers participate in boardsail-
ing activities, they must follow the complete Safety Afloat
guidelines reviewed in Chapter 12. The following list high-
lights Safety Afloat items adapted for boardsailing and
is consistent with various boardsailing safety codes.
Individuals should follow similar procedures.
1. Qualified Supervision. All boardsailing activity must
be supervised by a mature and conscientious adult
age 21 or older who understands and knowingly
accepts responsibility for the well-being and safety
of those in his or her care and who is trained in and
committed to compliance with the nine points of BSA
Safety Afloat. The supervisor must either be an expe-
rienced boardsailor knowledgeable in accident pre-
vention and prepared for emergency situations, or be
assisted by those with such experience.
2. Personal Health Review. A complete health history
from physician, parent, or legal guardian is required of
all participants as evidence of fitness for boardsailing.
3. Swimming Ability. Only persons who have completed
the standard BSA swimmer classification test may
ride on or control a sailboard. See Chapter 5 for a
review of the test.
4. Life Jacket. All persons must wear a properly fitted U.S.
Coast Guard–approved personal flotation device while
in or on the water during a boardsailing activity. A whis-
tle should be attached to each life jacket.
5. Buddy System. Each person on the water must have a
buddy, either on another board or other type of craft,
sailing close enough to monitor one another but far
enough apart to avoid collision.
6. Skill proficiency. Beginners should receive instruc-
tion in sailing skills and safety from an experienced
boardsailor. Only participants who have demon-
strated the ability to control the craft under existing
wind and water conditions should be allowed to sail
in open water. If needed, a triangular course may be
used to test ability before allowing participants to set
their own direction. Those who have trouble complet-
ing the course should receive additional instruction.
7. Planning and Safety
• Review local weather forecasts prior to the activity
and monitor conditions while on the water.
• Do not sail where winds or currents are directed
offshore into open water.
• Stay off the water during high winds, high waves,
or lightning.
• Check all equipment before going out—yours and
your buddy’s.
• In case of equipment failure or distress, stay with
the board.
• Determine how to summon help before going out.
• Use a float plan to advise others where you plan to
sail and when you expect to return.
• Plan to be off the water well before dusk. Do not sail
at night.
8. Equipment. All equipment should be safety checked
and repaired as needed before each use. Personal
gear should include a life jacket, a whistle, footwear,
and adequate protection from heat or cold. A rescue
craft is recommended for beginner groups. Begin-
ners should avoid high-performance boards.
9. Discipline. All participants should know, understand,
and follow the rules and procedures for safe board-
sailing. The rules should be adapted to the local envi-
ronment and reviewed with all participants at the
water’s edge just before the activity begins.
What Next?
The material in this chapter reviews skills and safety
items to support Boardsailing BSA training provided by a
qualified instructor. Although Boardsailing BSA provides
a basic introduction, there are additional skills used by
advanced boardsailors. Again, the best way to learn is
from someone with experience, whether just for fun or
for competition. Jibing is an alternative way to turn. Foot
straps and a harness allow better control of the board.
For additional opportunities, check out the websites men-
tioned at the start of this chapter.


Motorboating
A few Sea Scout units do training and extended cruising in large powered vessels, but for the most part, motorboating for
Scouts and the public at large involves a variety of smaller boats including johnboats with small outboard motors, bass boats
with large outboards, pontoon boats, multipurpose runabouts with stern drives, and inboards designed for waterskiing.
Chapter
25


Chapter 25: Motorboating264
According to BSA policies, a motorboat may be
operated by a youth, subject to state regulations, when
accompanied in the boat by an experienced leader or
camp staff member who meets state requirements for
motorboat operation. Most states set a minimum age for
motorboat operation—12 is most common but the range
is from 10 to 16 for states with age restrictions. Many of
the states with age restrictions also require an adult to be
onboard when a minor is operating a motor vessel. More
and more states are adding mandatory education and
licensing requirements. In some cases, requirements also
depend on the type of craft and horsepower. Some states
recognize certificates from other states, some do not.
Because regulations differ from state to state, each
leader supervising motorboat operation at a BSA function
must check and comply with local state requirements.
The website of the National Association of State Boating
Law Administrators (NASBLA), www.nasbla.org, contains
links to the appropriate agency in each state.
Some states offer courtesy rather than compulsory
powerboat education courses specific to local
regulations. The courses often can be taken over the
internet as well as in person. In states without such
offerings, there are various options for generic courses
that follow NASBLA recommendations. Check the
national websites for local chapters of the U.S. Coast
Guard Auxiliary, www.cgaux.org, or the United States
Power Squadrons, www.usps.org, for additional course
opportunities. Such courses are recommended for BSA
members who own and operate motorboats.

Chapter 25: Motorboating266
Basic Powerboat Operation
Many powerboat courses focus on cognitive material (that
is, rules and procedures in a classroom) rather than physical
demonstration and practice. The boat operator should have
actual boating experience before transporting others.
Motorboat operation has similarities to driving a car,
particularly if the boat has a steering wheel rather than a
tiller. Even though a boat steering wheel is often on the right
or starboard side, boats meeting head-on each veer to pass
left-to-left, the same as cars on an unmarked country road.
When boats are crossing, the boat to starboard has the
right-of-way but needs to check that the other boat is acting
accordingly. The same principles apply to cars at an
unmarked intersection or in an open parking lot. (Review
Chapter 15 for a more complete description of the rules of
the road.) A car driver can lose control striking an obstacle
in the road, swerving to avoid an object, or hitting a bump at
high speed. The same is true for a boater encountering a
floating log or crossing the wake of another vessel.
A powerboat operator also needs to understand that driv-
ing a boat is different from driving a car. For example, a
boat has no brakes. It either glides to a stop or is slowed
more quickly by shifting to reverse, if available. A boat
steers from the back rather than the front. A car will fol-
low the front wheels away from a curb when pulling for-
ward, whereas the front wheels will likely hit the curb if
pulling away in reverse. In a similar situation, the back of
a boat pulling forward away from a pier will swing into
the pier.
Trailering
Many boats are stored out of the water and transported
on trailers to and from waterways. The size of the trailer
will depend on the size and weight of the boat, includ-
ing the engine and all gear transported in the boat. Trail-
ers are rated by gross vehicle weight (GVW) and divided
into classes. Class I is for trailers carrying less than 2,000
pounds. Larger trailers will have dual axles and may
require separate trailer brakes. It is essential that the
towing vehicle and hitch are rated for the trailer. Car man-
ufacturers and insurance companies often restrict typi-
cal sedans and minivans to minimal towing loads. Larger
vehicles can be purchased with special towing packages
that include items such as additional cooling capacities,
Make sure the towing vehicle is rated for the load.
Do not risk a fall and being run over by standing
on the trailer tongue while the rig is moving.
Also, additional weight on the tongue may
engage some automatic trailer brakes.
Unhook trailer lights temporarily if not waterproof.
Insert plugs and remove
motor or drive supports
before launch.
Use the parking brake and chocks if needed.
Avoid running back tires into water. Do not submerge tailpipe.
Carry a spare trailer tire and
appropriate jack. Maintain
wheel lubrication.
Avoid backing off a ledge
at end of paved ramp.


Chapter 25: Motorboating 267
heavy-duty brakes, and larger side mirrors. Four-wheel
drive is useful on steep, slippery ramps.
The hitch should be attached to the vehicle frame.
Hitches are rated not only on total towing capacity but
also on tongue weight. A properly designed and loaded
trailer should be balanced with minimal force either push-
ing down or pulling up on the hitch. Trailer balls come in
different sizes and typically can be interchanged on the
hitch. Make sure the ball matches the trailer coupling.
The trailer should be attached to the hitch with criss-
crossed safety chains as well as a ball.
Backing a trailer is an essential skill but can be tricky.
Practice on open, level ground before attempting a steep,
narrow ramp with a line of other boats waiting to launch.
Getting Under Way
Before starting a gasoline engine in an enclosed com-
partment, that is, for inboard and stern drive units, run the
blower to clear any fumes that may have accumulated. If
the boat is equipped with a safety shut-off lanyard, attach
the lanyard to the driver before starting the engine.
Ideally, the boat should float free of the trailer, but in some
cases it may be necessary to power the boat off. Make
sure the prop is lowered to an operating position but is
clear of the bottom. In most cases, the motor is started in
neutral, but some small outboards may not have a gear-
shifting mechanism.
Attach the safety lanyard and run the blower prior to starting the engine.
Passengers should wait to board until the driver brings
the boat alongside the floating piers that generally are
provided for that purpose. (Don’t forget the person park-
ing the trailer.) Passengers should don life jackets, board
one at a time, and sit in positions indicated by the driver.
Everyone should have a seat. If there are more pas-
sengers than seats, except perhaps for a toddler sitting
on a parent’s lap, the boat’s design capacity has been
exceeded and it will be necessary to take turns. Don’t
overload the boat or allow passengers to ride on the
sides. Review basic safety precautions before leaving
the dock. Everyone should remain seated while the boat
is under way.


Chapter 25: Motorboating268
Planing
Most small powerboats are designed to plane. At low
speeds, the boat operates in displacement mode: the
bow pushes water to the sides while causing significant
friction. At higher speeds, the back of the boat glides
on top of the water. Motor away from the dock at low
speeds—the boat will generate a significant wake while
reaching a plane. Once in open water out of no-wake
zones, slowly but continuously open the throttle to gener-
ate more power. The boat may initially ride high on a bow
wave but should quickly level off after reaching planing
speed. Slowly back off the throttle to your desired cruis-
ing speed. It takes more power to reach a plane than to
maintain it. Power-to-speed ratios can be adjusted with
power trim tabs in boats so equipped. In most situations,
the stern unit should be lowered such that the prop shaft
is nearly parallel to the water when at rest. If the unit is
lowered too far with the prop shaft angled up, the bow
of the boat will plow and may not achieve a plane. If the
unit is not lowered enough, the boat squats, and steering
while on a plane may be compromised.
Displacement mode
Plane mode
When the motor is at too much of an angle, the boat “squats.”
When the motor is not placed at enough angle, the boat “plows.”
When the motor is placed correctly, the best performance will
be obtained.


Chapter 25: Motorboating 269
Turning
Although many powerboats will remain upright during
sharp turns at speed on flat water, it is generally better
to make gentle turns while planing and limit tight turns
to slow speeds. Turn the wheel or tiller slowly, rather
than putting it hard over. While turning, the back of the
boat will swing wide. Flat-bottomed boats may skid at
higher speeds, particularly if towing a skier. Remember
to always keep the boat under control. Avoid situations
where sudden turns are needed by not outrunning your
ability to see ahead.
Waves and Wakes
One potential consequence of a high-speed turn is that
a sharp turn into the trough of a wave could cause the
boat to flip. Small swells from the side will rock the boat
slightly but shouldn’t cause a problem at normal operat-
ing speeds. If possible, alter course to take large, isolated
waves from the wakes of passing boats at an angle, and
then resume your previous heading. Large continuous
waves should be taken at a slight angle off perpendicular.
Decelerate off a plane if control is lost due to pounding.
Deep V hulls with an enclosed foredeck and high free-
board will manage waves better than a small open out-
board, but the best way to handle large waves in any boat
is to get off the water before they develop. Remember
to always check the weather forecast before going out
and to keep an eye on the sky. Head back to the marina
if adverse weather is moving your way. In a pinch, if the
waves are large enough to jeopardize control or to bring
in water over the sides, temporarily forgo heading to the
marina and try to maintain sufficient power to keep the
boat headed into the waves at a slight angle.
Stopping
If you suddenly put the engine in neutral while planing,
the boat will not immediately stop but will slow down
quickly enough to throw your passengers forward. In
addition, your wake will continue forward and may spill
in over the stern. Plan ahead sufficiently so that you can
slowly reduce speed. An easy, controlled stop will take
several hundred feet if you are traveling fast. As you
reduce throttle, the boat will come off the plane. Continue
to reduce throttle to avoid running at intermediate speeds
just below planing. At those speeds, the bow lifts, which
interferes with visibility, and a large wake is generated.
As you approach a dock or trailer, it’s a good ideal to kill
all forward momentum a boat length or two away by short
bumps into reverse at low power. You can then proceed at
the boat’s slowest forward speed with a final short bump
into reverse if needed. Note that the rudder on an inboard
allows some steering capability if the boat is gliding for-
ward in neutral. However, outboards and stern drives rely
on the prop for steerage. Turning the wheel in neutral will
not have much effect.
You should be skilled enough to bring your boat to a stop
at the side of a pier or in a slip. In unfavorable winds or
currents, you may need to rely on a fender to absorb the
final momentum or a boat hook to close the final gap.
Throwing a line to someone already onshore may also be
handy. However, you should not expect or allow passen-
gers to jump off a moving boat or to grab a post to stop the
boat from crashing into the pier.


Chapter 25: Motorboating270
Four-Cycle Outboards
The standard for small outboard motors with a
single piston has shifted from two-cycle to
four-cycle operation. The newer versions may
be slightly more expensive with a bit more bulk
for motors with the same horsepower. However,
a four-cycle motor has better fuel efficiency and
less adverse environmental impact. Some states
have restricted the use of two-cycle engines,
and manufacturers have shifted emphasis to
four-cycle versions.
Personal Watercraft
The initially poor safety record and nuisance com-
plaints associated with personal watercraft have
been moderated with education, supervision,
regulation, and design changes. With approval from
the National Council, several local councils have
conducted popular and responsible operator train-
ing programs. Any council may now apply to the
National Council for approval to conduct a personal
watercraft (PWC) camp program. Consult National
Camp Accreditation Program (NCAP) standards for
details. However, unit use of personal watercraft by
youth is not an authorized BSA activity. Check the
online Guide to Safe Scouting at www.scouting.org
for current policies. Individuals who operate private
personal watercraft should note that the Personal
Watercraft Industry Association recommends
operator training and a minimum operator age of
16 even though regulations in several states are
less restrictive. Safety guidelines are available
at www.pwia.org and www.uscgboating.org.


Tow Sports
Tow sports in the aquatics environment include any activity in which a person is pulled in or above the water by a line
attached to a power source. The typical power source is a motorboat but could be a sailboat or a kite. Tow sports
include riding on flotation devices, waterskiing, kneeboarding, wakeboarding, parasailing, and kitesurfing. The last two
activities are not authorized as BSA youth activities.
Chapter
26


All participants in towed activity afloat must have suc-
cessfully completed the BSA swimmer classification
test and must wear a life jacket with an impact rating
consistent with the activity. Supervision must include
both a skilled boat driver and a separate observer. (A
rearview mirror is recommended for the driver and meets
minimal regulations in some states, but does not substi-
tute for the observer required by BSA policies.)
The skills needed by individuals participating in towed activi-
ties vary from simple to difficult. In many cases, the activity
itself will have components ranging from basic to extreme.
The activity leader should not allow participants to attempt
maneuvers without appropriate training, or maneuvers of
questionable safety. Basic waterskiing skills are discussed
in the Water Sports merit badge pamphlet. USA Water Ski is
the national governing body for competitive waterskiing, and
links to training programs for waterskiing, wakeboarding,
and kneeboarding can be found at www.usawaterski.org.
Tow sports and devices are continually evolving. Some
products are introduced and then recalled due to poor
safety records. In the absence of a specific BSA policy, the
unit leader is responsible for making reasonable judgments
about an activity’s safety, age appropriateness, and train-
ing requirements based on the leader’s own experience.
Questionable activities should be curtailed or postponed
until appropriate trained supervision becomes available.
Chapter 26: Tow Sports272


Water-Skier’s Safety Code
The following items support safe, enjoyable waterskiing
and also apply to wakeboarding and kneeboarding:
• Always learn to water-ski by taking instructions from
a good water-ski instructor or an advanced skier.
• Always wear a personal flotation device when ski-
ing. Before entering the water, make sure your life
jacket is adjusted correctly for safety, comfort, and
freedom of movement. Always make sure your life
jacket is in good serviceable condition.
• Always look ahead and know where you are going
at all times.
• Always stay away from solid objects such as docks,
boats, and stumps.
• Always be courteous and stay a reasonable dis-
tance from other skiers, boats, and swimmers.
• Always run parallel to shore and come in slowly
when landing.
• Always learn new maneuvers progressively.
• Always have an extra person in the boat to watch
the skier.
• Always signal that you are all right after a fall by
clasping your hands overhead to notify the driver
and observer.
• Always hold up a ski while waiting in the water in a
well-traveled boating area.
• Always check your equipment for dangerous, sharp, or
protruding objects (wing nuts, loose runner, slivers).
• Never ski in shallow water or in an area where you
do not know the depth. Minimum safe depth is 6 feet.
• Never put any part of your body through the bridle or
wrap the rope around any part of your body.
• Never yell “Hit it!” or “Go boat!” until the rope is
tight and the tips of your skis are up.
• Never ski to the point of exhaustion.
• Never ski at night. (Almost all states prohibit skiing
from dusk to dawn.)
• Never ski directly ahead of another boat.
• Never ski double with different lengths of rope.
• Never attempt fast landings directly toward shore.
• Never jump from the boat while it is moving.
• Never climb into the boat or approach the stern of
the boat while the motor is running. Always use a
stern platform or ladder when climbing into the boat.

Role of the Observer
The safety observer watches how the skier, boarder, or
float rider is doing; relays signals both ways between the
participant and driver; tells the boat driver if the partici-
pant falls; watches for potential hazards; and helps the
driver stay aware of traffic approaching from the rear.
The observer and skier should review signals before the
skier enters the water. Although signals are fairly stan-
dard, they vary slightly in some regions. For example,
some people indicate a turn by circling a hand overhead
and then pointing in the desired direction, others simply
point, and some employ the straight- and bent-arm sig-
nals used for bicycles. Agree on signals under way for
OK, stop, faster, slower, right turn, left turn, and return,
and make sure the skier knows to quickly use the skier
safe signal after a fall.
The observer is also in charge of the towrope. The
observer coils the line into the boat when the skier is
ready to board, pays it out when necessary for deepwa-
ter starts, and makes sure the line is clear prior to starts.
Boat Driver’s Safety Code
The boat driver should never forget that he or she is not
driving for personal pleasure. The boat is operated solely
for the benefit and safety of those being towed. All boat
drivers should observe the following:
• Always have an observer onboard to watch the
participant(s).
• Always return quickly to protect a fallen person, who
is helpless in the water against oncoming boat traffic.
Anyone being towed is your primary responsibility.
• Always drive according to the participant’s ability, and
avoid sharp turns.
• Always put the motor in neutral when passing a per-
son in the water.
• Always turn the motor off when picking up a person.
• Always use common sense and courtesy when driving.
• Always take a swimmer into the boat using a ladder
or low rear deck, avoiding any contact with the motor,
rudder, or drive.
• Never ride the gunwale or the back of the seat while
driving and do not allow passengers to ride that way.
• Never tow anyone in congested areas, particularly
swimming areas.

The driver looks ahead while the observer watches the

Chapter 26: Tow Sports274


Safe Boat Maneuvers
Keep passengers in the towboat to a minimum. Passen-
gers other than the observer and the skier’s buddy may
distract the driver. In a low-powered boat in particular,
unnecessary passengers make good starts more difficult.
Although a skier or boarder may request a takeoff by
shouting “Hit it!” the boat driver should not respond with-
out clear water ahead for a considerable distance. The
acceleration should not be so abrupt as to jerk the line
from the skier, but the boat will need to proceed quickly
to a plane, from which the driver should throttle back to
a speed that matches the skier’s ability and desire. The
driver should also avoid a turn during the takeoff by
checking that the towrope, the centerline of the boat, and
the prop axis are all approximately aligned. That check is
normally done when taking the slack out of the line.
The towboat should proceed in a straight line at uniform
speed except when turning to reverse direction or pick
up a fallen participant. Fishtailing or rapid speed changes
intended to upset a skier or to dislodge a rider are irre-
sponsible and inappropriate.
Ideally, the towpath should be clear of obstructions or
other vessels for roughly 100 feet to each side and at
least a quarter-mile long. Other boats should stay clear
of a boat and riders being towed. However, the tow driver
should be prepared to take appropriate evasive action
(either a wide swerve or a controlled stop) if other boats
continue on a crossing path.
Turns at the ends of a run should be a wide oval to avoid
pulling the participant through the boat wake. After the
turn, the towboat should proceed back along its previous
wake. At times, skiers may intentionally cross the wake
either during a straight run or during a turn. However, the
actions of the boat driver should not force the participant
to cross the wake. Water is typically smoother inside the
wake if there is chop on the open lake due to wind and
other boat traffic, and crossing the wake can be intimi-
dating for a beginner.
When a skier falls, the driver, through the observer, should
make certain the skier is all right and return as quickly as
safety permits if the skier fails to give the “safe” signal.
If the skier is all right, the driver should turn and idle back
toward the skier, approaching to pass on the driver’s side
Chapter 26: Tow Sports 275


for best visibility. As the boat approaches the skier, the
observer asks if the skier wishes to go again. If not, the
driver kills the engine and coasts abreast the person,
staying far enough away that the boat does not glide or
blow into the person. If boarding is from the stern, cau-
tion the skier to avoid sharp edges on any exposed drive
mechanism. Turning an outdrive away from the boarding
ladder may help.
To continue the run, the driver pulls abreast of the skier,
but still at least 10 to 12 feet away, and then starts a sharp
turn around the skier at idle speed. If the driver continues
to turn in a half circle completely around the skier, the
boat will be positioned to continue in the same direction
it was going when the skier fell.
Alternatively, if the driver starts a tight turn around the
skier followed by a sharp turn in the opposite direction, the
S-shape course will bring the towline close to the skier. The
new course will be reversed relative to the previous run.
Towed Flotation Devices
(Tubing)
The roles and responsibilities of the boat driver and observer
while towing riders on a float are similar to those while tow-
ing people on water skis or wakeboards.
Persons on flotation devices should be towed at slow speed
well away from any obstacles. A prudent speed depends
somewhat on the design of the float, that is, how secure the
passengers are, and the age and comfort level of the partici-
pants. The driver should immediately honor any requests to
slow down, even if given contradictory instructions by other
riders. The driver should also ignore requests for greater
speeds at which the float becomes unstable. Only use floats
specifically designed for towing. Each rider should have a
secure grasp on the device, not on another rider. Don’t rig
makeshift floats using car or truck tire inner tubes.
The number of riders on a float plus the number of people
in the towboat, which must include at least the driver and
an observer, must not exceed the towboat’s rated occu-
pant capacity. Given that requirement, the easy way to
start the tow and retrieve riders is in deep water away
from congested beaches or launch areas. That avoids
potential problems with trying to tow the device into shal-
low water or to a pier for riders to board and disembark.
Chapter 26: Tow Sports276


If more than one person is on the float, and one falls off,
the others should remain with the float while the boat
turns to retrieve the fallen passenger. The procedure is
similar to picking up a fallen skier. Make sure riders know
to use the hands-overhead “safe” signal.
“Skier Down” Flags
Some states require the towboat to display a 12-by-12-
inch orange flag when the boat is moving to pick up a
fallen skier, boarder, or float rider. Because regulations
differ from state to state, each leader supervising a towing
activity during a BSA function must check and comply
with local requirements. The website of the National
Association of State Boating Law Administrators, www.
nasbla.org, contains links to the appropriate regulatory
agency in each state.
Unauthorized Activities
Parasailing is a popular concession at many
resort areas. A patron is lifted high above the water
wearing a parachute while being towed by a boat.
In some cases, the participant is winched down to a
platform on the back of the moving craft and never
enters the water. Parasailing and other aerial activi-
ties such as static parachute jumps, skydiving, para-
gliding, and hang gliding are not authorized youth
activities for BSA groups.
Kitesurfing is somewhat similar to wakeboarding
except the towline is pulled by a kite held by the
rider rather than a motorboat. Even though modern
rig designs have led to increased control, control is
still uncertain and there is a reasonable expecta-
tion that the participant will become airborne, either
accidentally or intentionally. It is not unusual for a
participant to be pulled off the board. Therefore,
some users attach themselves to the board with a
lanyard. However, head injuries, even when a helmet
is worn, sometimes result from the lanyard pulling
the board into the participant. In some areas, there
have been problems with overhead obstructions,
such as power lines. This sport is not an authorized
BSA youth activity.

Council Aquatics Committees
Local BSA aquatics programming is enhanced when a council aquatics committee promotes activities, helps procure
equipment and instructors, and provides guidance to unit leaders and council professionals. Interested volunteers
should check with their local council service center. Some committees have been active for years but need an influx
of new members to remain viable. In other councils, the aquatics committee may not exist or may be inactive. In that
case, an interested volunteer is needed to work with council professionals to generate sufficient interest to form an
active committee. The following material is a guide to aquatics committee organization, responsibilities and activities.
Appendix
1


Appendix 1: Council Aquatics Committees288
Organization
The aquatics committee has overall responsibility for
the local council’s aquatics activities in Cub Scouting,
Boy Scouting, Venturing, and Exploring. Within the local
council organization, the aquatics committee reports to
the vice president of program or to the vice president of
health and safety. The aquatics committee may be a sep-
arate committee or a subcommittee within the camping
or health and safety committees.
Members of the aquatics committee should be expe-
rienced Scouters with a background in aquatics, or
aquatics specialists interested in becoming involved
in Scouting. The committee should include at least one
individual with a current National Camping School BSA
Aquatics Instructor training card.
Besides swimming and water-rescue specialists, the com-
mittee should include specialists for the type of aquatics
activities prevalent in the local council (e.g., snorkeling/
scuba, canoe tripping, sailing, whitewater, crew rowing,
waterskiing, Sea Scouting, etc.). Select committee mem-
bers should be members of or liaisons to other council
committees that touch the aquatics committee’s areas
of responsibility including training, advancement, health
and safety, camping, etc.
Camp aquatics directors hired by the council for the sum-
mer should be ex officio members of the committee dur-
ing their term of employment and afterward encouraged
to become full-time, year-round volunteer members.
Responsibilities
The aquatics committee’s main responsibilities include
the following year-round activities tailored to the local
council’s aquatics activities and opportunities:
• Training. Work with the council training committee to
provide aquatics training for adults and youth.
• Program. Provide and promote a broad array of basic
and high-adventure swimming and boating activities
to support all parts of the Scouting program.
• Advancement. Provide advancement opportunities
for youth.
• Safety. Actively assess safe operation of council- and
district-led aquatics activities including summer camp
and promote aquatics safety at the unit level.
• Attraction, Development, and Retention of Aquatics
Leadership. A primary role of the committee is attract-
ing, developing, and retaining qualified aquatics lead-
ers for the training, program, advancement, and safety
activities above. This includes summer camp and year-
round council- and district-led aquatics activities and
should include succession planning for key roles.
Key Activities
Local council aquatics committee activities should
include but are not limited to the following items, grouped
by the responsibilities listed above.
Training
• Safe Swim Defense and Safety Afloat
• Basic swimming and boating skills training for
unit leaders
• Basic water-rescue skills training for unit leaders
• Development of unit aquatics activities for unit leaders
• Camp aquatics staff training in:
—Aquatics skills
—Effective teaching of aquatics skills
—Aquatics safety including lifeguarding
• Basic canoeing
• Basic crew rowing
• Basic whitewater
• Nonswimmer instruction
1. Qualified Supervision. All activity afloat must be supervised by
a mature and conscientious adult age 21 or older who under-
stands and knowingly accepts responsibility for the well-being
and safety of those in his or her care, and who is trained and
committed to compliance with the nine points of BSA Safety
Afloat. That supervisor must be skilled in the safe operation of
the craft, knowledgeable in accident prevention, and prepared
for emergency situations. Additional leadership is provided
in ratios of 1 to 5 for Cub Scouts and 1 to 10 for Boy Scouts
and Venturers. At least one leader must be trained in CPR. It is
strongly recommended that all units have at least one member
trained in BSA Paddle Craft Safety to assist in activity afloat.
2. Personal Health Review. Adjust supervision to anticipate any
potential risks identified by review of required health histories.
3. Swimming Ability. Operation of any boat is limited to those
who have completed the BSA swimmer classification test.
Those not classified as swimmers may ride as passengers
on calm water when there is little chance of capsizing or
falling overboard.
4. Personal Flotation Equipment. Approved, properly fitted PFDs
must be worn by all persons engaged in boating activity.
5. Buddy System. All participants are paired as buddies and
monitor the safety of the other.
6. Skill Proficiency. Everyone must have sufficient knowledge
and skill to participate safely.
7. Planning. Float plans should include a scheduled itinerary, noti-
fication of appropriate parties, communication arrangements,
contingencies in case of foul weather or equipment failure, and
emergency options.
8. Equipment. All equipment must suit the activity, meet regula-
tory standards, be properly sized, and be in good repair. Emer-
gency gear must be available.
9. Discipline. All participants should know, understand, and
respect the rules and procedures for safe boating activities
provided by Safety Afloat guidelines.

Merit Badge Counselors
The following material reviews the BSA merit badge program for aquatics specialists from other organizations inter-
ested in volunteering as counselors. Subject-specific information is found in the merit badge pamphlets; counselors
should review that information before conducting merit badge sessions.

Appendix 2: Merit Badge Counselors292
The Aims of Scouting
The Scouting program is an educational program aimed
at teaching youth character development, citizenship, and
mental and physical fitness. These aims of Scouting are
accomplished through the use of eight fundamental methods:
• The ideals of Scouting (Scout Oath, Scout Law, Scout
motto, Scout slogan)
• The patrol method
• The outdoors
• Advancement
• Association with adults
• Personal growth
• Leadership development
• The uniform
What Is Advancement?
Advancement is the process by which a Scout progresses
from rank to rank in the Scouting program. It is simply a
means to an end and not an end in itself. Everything done
to advance and earn higher ranks is designed to help the
Scout have an exciting and meaningful experience.
The advancement method is designed to encourage a
young man to accomplish a progressive series of fun and
educational tasks. Earning merit badges allows Scouts to
explore many fields, helps them round out their skills, and
perhaps introduces them to subjects that will become
lifelong interests or rewarding careers.
What Is a Merit Badge?
A special part of a Scout’s learning adventure, merit badges
are awards presented to when a Scout has completed the
requirements for one of the merit badge subjects. There are
more than 100 merit badges a Scout may earn. The subject
matters range from vocational and careers introduction
to personal development, hobbies, sports, high adventure,
citizenship, and life-skills development.
Every merit badge is designed to teach the Scouts new skills
while actively encouraging them to challenge themselves
and have fun in the process. Merit badges offer a range of
difficulty over a breadth of subject matters, and each Scout
is free to pursue any merit badge they wish. The merit badge
itself is a simple embroidered patch, but the intangible end
result of earning it is that the Scout gains self-confidence
from overcoming obstacles to achieve a goal.
Why Does the BSA Use Merit
Badge Counselors?
One of the methods of Scouting is association with quality
adults. Besides a Scout’s parents and relatives, school-
teachers, religious leaders, and possibly sports coaches,
most Scout-age youth do not have much contact with
many other adults or professionals. Merit badge counsel-
ors provide an excellent means for each Scout to grow
through exposure to outstanding adults who serve as
examples and mentors to them. The opportunity to deal
with business leaders, trained specialists, and experi-
enced hobbyists while pursuing a merit badge offers
the Scout a chance for personal growth and possibly a
life-altering experience.
The BSA recognizes that the merit badge counselor is
the cornerstone to the merit badge program. By offering
their time, experience, and knowledge to guide Scouts
in one or more merit badge subjects, counselors help
shape the future of our country. By assisting as the Scout
plans projects and activities necessary to meet the merit
badge requirements, and by coaching the Scout through
interviews and demonstrations, the quality adult contact
fostered by this working relationship can only enhance the
Scout’s self-confidence and growth.
What Is a Merit
Badge Counselor?
A merit badge counselor serves as both a teacher and
a mentor as the Scout works on the merit badge. Merit
badge counselors should be satisfied that each Scout
under their guidance meets all the requirements set forth
for the merit badge. In this sense, a merit badge coun-
selor is an examiner. In a larger sense, the real oppor-
tunity for a counselor lies in coaching—helping Scouts
over the different hurdles of the requirements and helping
make them aware of the deeper aspects of the subject
from their knowledge and experience.
The merit badge counselor may help a Scout by providing
instruction and guidance on the subject matter. However,
the counselor must not complete the Scout’s work on the
requirements. The counselor needs to test the Scout to
ensure that all the required work has been completed
but may not modify the merit badge requirements in the
process. This standard ensures that the advancement
requirements are fair and uniform for all Scouts.


Appendix 2: Merit Badge Counselors 293
A merit badge counselor must always ensure that a Scout
has a “buddy” present at all instruction sessions. Working
on merit badges is especially enjoyable when Scouts work
together, and the BSA encourages this by making the
buddy system a part of the merit badge program. Together
the two meet with merit badge counselors, plan projects,
and keep their enthusiasm high. The Scout’s buddy could
be another Scout, a parent or guardian, brother or sister,
relative, or friend. The Scout should bring a buddy to all
appointments with the counselor.
Merit Badge Counselor
Requirements and Registration
To qualify as a merit badge counselor, a volunteer must:
• Take Youth Protection training within 30 days
of registering.
• Register annually with the Boy Scouts of America.
• Be at least 18 years old.
• Be of good character.
• Be proficient in the merit badge subject by vocation,
avocation, or special training.
• Be able to work with Scout-age youth.
• Be approved by the district/council advance-
ment committee.
To register with the Boy Scouts of America, a potential
merit badge counselor must complete the BSA’s Adult
Application form (No. 524-501; available in Spanish as
No. 524-502) and submit it along with the BSA Merit
Badge Counselor Information form (No. 34405) to the BSA
local council office. Renewal of this registration annually
is necessary to continue as a merit badge counselor.
The Boy Scouts of America requires every merit badge
counselor to take BSA Youth Protection training before
working with youth. This program addresses strategies
for personal safety awareness for youth as well as adults.
BSA Youth Protection policies include:
• Two-deep leadership
• No one-on-one contact
• Respecting privacy
• Reporting problems
The BSA Youth Protection guidelines have been adopted
primarily for the protection of our youth members; however,
they also serve to protect our adult volunteers and leaders
from false accusations of abuse. BSA Youth Protection
training is available online at https://my.Scouting.org
The Merit Badge Process
The requirements for each merit badge appear in the current
BSA merit badge pamphlet for that award and in the current
edition of the Boy Scout Requirements book, available at
Scout shops and council service centers. When a Scout has
decided on a merit badge they would like to earn, they obtain
from their Scoutmaster the name and phone number of the
district/council-approved merit badge counselor. At this
time, the Scoutmaster also can issue the Scout a signed
Application for Merit Badge (blue card).
The Scout telephones the merit badge counselor to make
an appointment, and together they schedule a date and
time for the Scout and buddy to meet. The counselor
suggests that the Scout bring the merit badge pamphlet,
the Application for Merit Badge, and any work he has
started or accomplished, and that he prepare by reading
over the requirements.
At their first meeting, the merit badge counselor and the
Scout decide upon a tentative schedule for completing the
requirements. They should keep the Scout’s other
obligations (Scouting, school, worship, etc.) in mind, and
set the dates, times, and locations for future meetings. The
counselor will explain the requirements for the badge and
help the Scout plan ways of fulfilling the requirements
while getting the most out of the experience.
Merit badge counselors help Scouts meet the require-
ments for the merit badge. They may expand on the
information in the merit badge pamphlet based on their
knowledge, experience, and expertise in the subject.
They are encouraged to tell about their own experiences
that positively reinforce the subject matter, but new
requirements or additional work may not be added. The
Scout is expected to meet the requirements for the merit
badge as stated—no more and no less.
The number of counseling sessions will depend on the
difficulty of the merit badge requirements and the Scout’s
preparation and ability. The Scout and counselor are
expected to meet as many times as is necessary for the
Scout to complete the requirements for the badge. The


Appendix 2: Merit Badge Counselors294
advancement program allows the Scout to move ahead in
their own way and at their own pace. Rather than competing
against others, each Scout commits to a personal challenge
of going as far as their ambition will carry them. The rate of
advancement depends upon their interest, effort, and ability.
As the Scout completes each requirement, they are always
tested (but with a buddy present), and as each requirement
is completed, the merit badge counselor marks it on the
application. When all the requirements for the merit badge
are fulfilled, the merit badge counselor certifies that the
Scout has completed the requirements. The Scout may
return their completed Application for Merit Badge (blue
card, if one is used) to their Scoutmaster.
Counseling Techniques
The most productive environment for the Scout when meet-
ing with the merit badge counselor will be one in which the
Scout feels welcome and relaxed. Start the conversation
by finding out what the Scout already knows about the
subject, then stimulate their interest by showing them
something related to it. Be careful not to overwhelm the
Scout. (Remember: The Scout is probably a beginner.)
Establish an atmosphere that encourages the Scout to ask
questions and to ask for help when they need it.
Spend some time helping the Scout learn the requirements,
making sure they know they should do exactly what the
requirements call for, whether “show” or “demonstrate,”
“make,” “list,” “discuss,” “explain,” or “collect, identify, and
label.” Take a genuine interest in their projects, and encour-
age the Scout to complete them.
Remember that the requirements must be completed
exactly as presented—do not expand any requirement.
However, the Scout may undertake more activities on
their own initiative. The merit badge counselor can
encourage this without pushing the Scout off course.
Encourage the Scout to practice for their review session
and to reflect on their accomplishments. The Scout might
approach the review process with some apprehension.
The Scout is familiar with final exams in school and may
see this meeting with the counselor as another such expe-
rience. The counselor can help by talking to the Scout
rather than grilling or examining them—there’s a big
difference, yet it still will be evident what the Scout knows.
Expressing honest enthusiasm for the things the Scout has
done will give them confidence.
During testing, the merit badge counselor may find that
the Scout needs help learning a particular area. The
counselor teaches the needed skill, and then retests to
ensure the area has been learned.
Fast Facts for the Merit Badge Counselor
• A merit badge counselor can counsel any Scout,
including their own child—although this is
discouraged in order to offer a Scout the chance
to meet a diverse group of outstanding adults.
• A counselor may be certified in unlimited merit
badge subjects, but he or she must be approved
for each one.
• There is no limit on the number of merit badges
that a counselor may counsel with one Scout.
However, the Scout will benefit the most from
working with a variety of outstanding adults.
• A merit badge counselor may limit his or her
services to one unit but still must be approved
by the council advancement committee.
• Scoutmasters and assistant Scoutmasters
are not automatically approved as merit
badge counselors.
• Group instruction is acceptable, but each Scout
must be tested and passed individually.
• There is no time limit for completion of merit
badges, but all work on merit badges must be
completed before the Scout’s 18th birthday.
Summer Camp Merit
Badge Counselors
The same qualifications and rules apply to counselors for
council summer camp merit badge programs. All counsel-
ors must be 18 years or older, but qualified camp staff mem-
bers under age 18 may assist the merit badge counselor
with instruction. (These assistants are not qualified to sign
off on a Scout’s blue card, nor may they certify the Scout’s
completion of a merit badge.) As always, each counselor
must maintain the exact standards as outlined in the merit
badge requirements—nothing deleted, nothing added.
Partial completion of merit badges at summer camp
should be credited to a Scout on the Application for Merit
Badge (blue card) and given to their Scoutmaster at the
end of the week.

Excerpt From the Declaration of Religious Principle
The BSA maintains that no member can grow into the best kind of citizen without recognizing an obligation to God and, therefore, recognizes
the religious element in the training of the member, but it is absolutely nonsectarian in its attitude toward that religious training. Its policy
is that the home and organization or group with which the member is connected shall give definite attention to religious life. Only persons
willing to subscribe to these precepts from the Declaration of Religious Principle and the Bylaws of the BSA shall be entitled to register.

Appendix 3: Requirements and Application Forms300
The Snorkeling BSA requirements introduce the
special skills, equipment, and safety precautions
associated with snorkeling; encourage the
development of aquatics skills that promote fitness
and recreation; and provide a foundation for
those who later will participate in more advanced
underwater activity.
Any youth or adult who is registered with a troop,
crew, or ship and completes the requirements
is eligible for a patch and recognition card. The
completed award application should be handled
as directed by the council Training, Aquatics, or
other committee.
All counselors must have current Safe Swim
Defense training and council approval. Anyone
currently trained as a BSA Aquatics Instructor
or certified as a snorkeling instructor by a BSA
recognized scuba training agency may serve
as a counselor for the Snorkeling BSA award.
Councils may also approve counselors who have
been trained and are supervised by those with the
previously listed credentials.
Instruction must be conducted in clear, confined
water with a maximum depth of 12 feet. A swimming
pool is recommended. Snorkeling BSA is ideally
suited to winter programs using indoor pools. Three
45-minute sessions are recommended for instruction,
practice, and completion of requirements.
All aspects of Safe Swim Defense apply during
instruction, practice, and all other snorkeling
activities. Snorkeling in open water requires each
participant to first demonstrate knowledge and skills
equivalent to the Snorkeling BSA requirements.
Aquatics Supervision: A Leader’s Guide to Youth
Swimming and Boating Activities, No. 34346,
provides reference material for Snorkeling BSA
instruction. Scuba training agencies, equipment
manufacturers, and others occasionally publish
references available online and through bookstores
and dive shops. Although few dedicated snorkeling
texts are available, instruction manuals for scuba
diving contain pertinent information.
All requirements must be completed as stated on
the application form. The counselor may not omit,
vary, or add requirements. The skill requirements
are listed in an order appropriate for instruction.
The second requirement considers the time-
honored and time-proven principle of the buddy
system. Snorkelers must use the buddy system
at all times. Before beginning the activity, each
person helps their buddy fit and check equipment.
The principle of the buddy system is that two
people can enjoy an aquatics activity together
while each provides a critical margin of safety for
the other. Each buddy must constantly be aware
of the condition and circumstances of their buddy,
and must always be prepared to call for aid or give
immediate assistance if needed.

Appendix 3: Requirements and Application Forms 301
Scuba BSA Application
Requirements
1. Before doing other requirements, successfully complete
the BSA swimmer test. To begin the test, jump feetfirst
into water over the head in depth, level off, and begin
swimming. Swim 75 yards in a strong manner using
one or more of the following strokes: sidestroke,
breaststroke, trudgen, or crawl; then swim 25 yards

be completed in one swim without stops and must
include at least one sharp turn. After completing the
swim, rest by floating.
2. Discuss the importance of using the buddy system
at all times while scuba diving. Explain that a dive
buddy is there to assist with the donning and doffing
of equipment, to lend assistance in case of emergency,
and to share in the underwater experience. Remember,
always dive with a buddy—Never dive alone!
3. Review hazards associated with scuba diving, including
causes of decompression incidents, and safety
procedures to avoid them. Explain the importance of
never using scuba equipment unless you are enrolled
in a training exercise or have completed a diver
certification program taught by a certified instructor.
4. State the purpose of the following pieces of basic diving
equipment: mask, fins, BCD, BCD inflator, regulator, air
gauge, and alternate air source.
5. Describe how to locate the air gauge, and explain how
to recognize the “caution zone” on it.
6. Don and adjust mask, fins, snorkel, BCD, scuba, and
weights with the assistance of a buddy, an instructor,
or a certified assistant.

Appendix 3: Requirements and Application Forms302
The Scuba BSA program was created and implemented with
assistance from International PADI Inc., www.padi.com.
All aspects of the Scuba BSA program must conform with
the BSA scuba policy found in the Guide to Safe Scouting.
Instructors not familiar with the Scouting program should
consult the BSA manual, Aquatics Supervision: A Leader’s
Guide to Youth Swimming and Boating Activities, No. 34346,
which also contains the BSA scuba policy.
Counselors for Scuba BSA must hold current scuba
instructor certification from PADI, NAUI, SSI, or RSTC
member organizations. Instruction must comply with RSTC
standards for introductory scuba experiences. Minimum
standards include instructor-to-participant ratios. In a pool,
the maximum ratio is eight participants per instructor. In
a confined waterfront setting, the maximum ratio is four
participants per instructor. Ratios may be increased by two
participants if the instructor is assisted by someone certified
as a divemaster or assistant instructor.
A second adult who understands the procedures should
be present in case the instructor becomes incapacitated.
Two-deep adult leadership is also required by BSA Youth
Protection guidelines.
Before participants are allowed in the water, they
must complete an Annual Health and Medical Record
designed for scuba activities. Instructors should use
standard forms advocated by their certifying agency.
Instructors may use agency materials, such as participant
guidebooks, slide shows, and videos to help convey
cognitive material. Skill instruction must be conducted in
clear, confined water. A swimming pool is recommended.
Scuba BSA is ideally suited to winter programs using
indoor pools. Two 45-minute sessions are appropriate for
instruction, practice, and completion of requirements.
Although Scuba BSA is similar to introductory scuba
experiences offered by various RSTC member organizations
and other dive agencies, those programs are not substitutes
for Scuba BSA. All requirements must be completed as
stated on the application form. The counselor may not omit,
vary, or add requirements. In particular, Scuba BSA has
a prerequisite swimming requirement, is only available to
youth and adults registered in the Boy Scout, Venturing, or
Sea Scout programs (minimum age around 10½), and does
not include the option of an open-water dive.
Local council programs may not compress or sell air for
scuba use, or sell, rent, or loan scuba equipment. All air
and equipment for local council Scuba BSA programs
must be obtained from properly licensed sources, not
affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America and under the
supervision of PADI, NAUI, SSI, or RSTC-approved and
certified scuba instructors.
Individuals completing the Scuba BSA requirements qualify
for a recognition card and patch. The completed award
application should be handled as directed by the council
Training, Aquatics, or other committee.

Appendix 3: Requirements and Application Forms 303
Mile Swim BSA Application
How Important Is Exercise?
Regular exercise is an important contributor to a long
and healthy life. For example, exercise lowers several risk
factors for heart disease. People who exercise regularly
are much less likely to be overweight. Not only does
exercise burn calories, it may actually suppress appetite.
Blood pressure is reduced by exercise. The combination
of exercise and weight reduction often allows people with
hypertension to control their blood pressure without the
use of medication. Smokers commonly discontinue that
habit as they begin exercise programs. Active joggers
tend to have lower total cholesterol than those who do
not run. When it comes to protecting your heart, there is
no substitute for exercise.
Without sufficient exercise, bones become demineralized.
They lose calcium and become brittle. Demineralization
can progress rapidly in those who are bedridden and
cannot exercise. Demineralization is a concern for
astronauts since lack of gravity robs activity of its exercise
value. Weak and brittle bones, caused by lack of exercise,
are common in senior adults.
Exercise is an excellent cardiovascular conditioner and
important to living better as well as longer. People who
exercise regularly feel and look younger than those who
do not. Improvements in muscle tone and circulation
undoubtedly contribute to freedom from fatigue and the
feeling of well-being that the physically fit enjoy.
Swimming is to some degree superior to other forms of
exercise because it is a full-body exercise (all muscles
and joints are exercised) and because it avoids the risk
of damage to joints and other parts of the body that may
result from activity such as running. The extensive use of
swimming therapy for the injured and impaired is further
evidence of its value as a body conditioner.

Appendix 3: Requirements and Application Forms304
Mile Swim BSA: Notes to Counselor
The Mile Swim BSA recognition provides a sense of
accomplishment and supports confidence, safety, skill,
and physical fitness. The ability to swim long distances in
warm water in time of need provides a margin of safety
for all aquatics activities. Swimming skills and physical
stamina are also needed to assist others. In addition to
safety, Mile Swim BSA should encourage the development
of physical fitness by introducing youth to swimming as
regular exercise. However, it is not a competitive training
program limited to specific strokes that emphasize speed
over efficiency. Swimming skills, including mastery of restful
strokes, are as important to the program as endurance.
Anyone who can walk a mile without stopping should
have sufficient stamina to swim a mile with restful strokes.
Just as walking is a viable exercise alternative to jogging
or sprinting, restful swimming strokes used over long
distances in place of a fast crawl can also play a positive
role in physical conditioning.
Counselors for Mile Swim BSA must be approved by the
council. Adults trained as a BSA Aquatics Instructor, a Red
Cross Water Safety Instructor, or a YMCA Swim Instructor
are good candidates. Swim coaches with a Scouting
background are also appropriate. All counselors must
have current Safe Swim Defense training.
All in-water exercises must conform to Safe Swim
Defense guidelines. The requirements specify that the
participant first prepare before swimming a continuous
mile. Four sessions of an hour each are appropriate. Each
session should include a discussion of objectives, warm-
up, stroke tips, and swims for increased distances. Short
sprints may be included to illustrate different levels of
aerobic exercise. The groundwork sessions are intended
to ensure the success of all applicants who begin with
reasonable swimming skills. The goal is encouragement
and skill refinement, not elimination. Virtually all of those
who participate in the training should be able to complete
the mile, particularly if they are shown how to refine the
crawl stroke using rhythmic breathing with the head in
the water and to use alternative restful strokes such as
the elementary backstroke, the breaststroke, and the
sidestroke that utilize a relaxed pace and a glide.
The training sessions may be conducted separately or in
combination with another program, such as instruction for
the Swimming merit badge. Credit may be given anyone,
such as a swim-team member, who provides evidence
of regular participation in a supervised swim training or
fitness program that covers at least four hours over four
different, regularly scheduled sessions.
The continuous mile may be done using any combination
of strokes and has no time limit. The swimmer may pause
in deep water either by floating or treading water but may
not rest by standing or holding to the side. Both open and
flip turns are allowed in pools.
The mile may be covered by laps in a pool or at an enclosed
waterfront swimming area.
Courses over extended distances in open water must
conform to Safe Swim Defense guidelines regarding
hazards such as submerged trees, currents, or boat traffic,
as well as water quality, depth, and clarity.
Each individual swimmer, or at most a buddy pair, may
be accompanied by a rowboat with two people onboard,
one skilled in controlling the boat and the other trained in
basic water rescue, equipped with a reaching device and
a flotation aid, continuously watching the swimmer(s). The
swimmer, not the boat, must set the pace.
Alternatively, a closed circuit may be established where
all swimmers are constantly in reach of safety personnel
strategically positioned at fixed points on anchored boats,
the shore, or piers. Each participant swims with a buddy,
and the number and spacing of those in the water should
not exceed the capacity of the watchers to easily count
the swimmers as they move from one zone to another.

Appendix 3: Requirements and Application Forms310
Notes to Counselor
This award is available to BSA youth and adults who are
members of Boy Scout, Venturing, or Sea Scout units. Any
adult leader, approved by the council, who is trained in Safety
Afloat and can personally verify that all instruction and skill
completions were directly supervised by a professionally
trained or licensed rafting guide may serve as a counselor for
this award. Such guides may be employed by council high-
adventure programs or commercial outfitters. Guidance for
selecting a reputable rafting service is provided in the BSA
publication Aquatics Supervision, No. 34346.


Appendix 3: Requirements and Application Forms 311
BSA Aquatics Supervision: Swimming and Water Rescue
Purpose
Training for Aquatics Supervision: Swimming and Water
Rescue provides BSA leaders with information and skills
to prevent, recognize, and respond to swimming emergen-
cies during unit swimming activities. It expands the aware-
ness instruction provided by Safe Swim Defense training.
Persons completing the training should be better able to
assess their preparation to supervise unit swimming events.
The BSA recommends that at least one person with this
training is present to assist with supervision whenever a
unit swims at a location that does not provide lifeguards.
This training is open to any registered adult leader, Scout,
Venturer, or Explorer who is age 15 or older. A council-approved
instructor must directly supervise all training. The course
takes approximately eight hours and is valid for three years.
An instructor guide is found at www.scouting.org/filestore/
Outdoor%20Program/Aquatics/pdf/430-505.pdf.
Although the training is consistent with training provided
professional lifeguards, the Swimming and Water Rescue
course is not a lifeguard training course and is not a substi-
tute for BSA Lifeguard training for summer camp aquatics
staff. On the other hand, this course addresses important
information that may not be covered in generic lifeguard
training programs such as: preventative measures, includ-
ing the buddy system and swim classification tests; how to
set up a safe swim area in diverse situations; the use of non-
standard rescue equipment; and emergency action plans
in remote settings. Therefore, BSA leaders with lifeguard
training from other agencies are encouraged to complete
this course prior to supervising unit swim activities in remote
settings. A “challenge” option is provided to foster cross-
training of individuals with training from other agencies.
Adult and youth first aid training, including CPR, is an
important safety consideration for all Scouting activities,
not just swimming. First aid training is not included in the
Swimming and Water Rescue course with the expectation
the leader has addressed this need separately, as noted in
the course material and on the training card.
Prerequisites
1. Age, physical fitness, and training:
A. Be 15 years old or older prior to training.
B. Submit written evidence of physical fitness.
C. Complete Safe Swim Defense training.
2. Swimming ability:
A. Complete the BSA swimmer test: Jump feetfirst
into water over the head in depth. Level off and
swim 75 yards in a strong manner using one or
more of the following strokes: sidestroke, breast
stroke, trudgen, or crawl; then swim 25 yards
using an easy, resting backstroke. The 100 yards
must be completed in one swim without stops
and must include at least one sharp turn. After
completing the swim, rest by floating.
B. Recover a 10-pound weight from 8 feet of water.
Requirements
3. Administer both the BSA beginner and swimmer clas-
sification tests.
4. Demonstrate reaching assists from deck, side, and
shallow water using items such as arms, legs, towels,
rescue tubes, and poles.
5. Twice demonstrate throwing assists using items such
as lines, ring buoys, throw bags, and free-floating sup-
ports. Successfully place at least one such aid within
reach of a subject 25 feet from shore.
6. Demonstrate stride jump and compact jump entries
into deep water.
7. Demonstrate an accompanied rescue for a conscious
subject in deep water 20 feet from shore. Enter the
water with a buoyant aid, present the aid to the sub-
ject, release it, and accompany the subject to shore.
Speak to the subject throughout the assist to provide
clear instruction and encouragement.
8. Demonstrate a contact rescue for an unconscious
subject at or near the surface in deep water 20 feet
from shore:
A. Approaching the subject from the front, use a
wrist tow to move the subject to shore. During the
approach, confirm that the subject is passive.
B. Approaching the subject from the rear, use an
armpit tow to move the subject to shore. During
the approach, confirm that the subject is passive.
C. With the assistance of one other person,
and without the aid of a backboard, remove
an unconscious subject from the water at the
edge of the pool or pier and check for breathing
and circulation.
9. Practice in-water rescues of both conscious and
unconscious subjects using a variety of flotation aids.
10. Demonstrate the following defensive actions:
A. Front head-hold escape
B. Rear head-hold escape
11. Demonstrate a line-and-tender rescue as both the
swimmer and the line tender.
12. Demonstrate in-line stabilization for a suspected spi-
nal injury in shallow water:
A. For a faceup subject
B. For a facedown subject
13. Correctly answer 80 percent of the questions on the
Swimming and Water Rescue written exam covering
Safe Swim Defense, emergency action plans, surveil-
lance, victim recognition, and water rescue. Review
any incomplete or incorrect answers.

Appendix 3: Requirements and Application Forms312
BSA Aquatics Supervision: Paddle Craft Safety—Basic
Purpose
Float trips are popular Boy Scout and Venturing activities.
Safety Afloat awareness training provides guidelines for
safe float trips and is required of unit leaders, but does
not provide the skill training mandated by those guide-
lines. Aquatics Supervision: Paddle Craft Safety—Basic
expands Safety Afloat training to include the skills, as
well as the knowledge, needed for a unit leader to confi-
dently supervise canoeing or kayaking excursions on flat
water. Persons completing the training should be better
able to access their preparation to supervise paddle craft
activities. The training is open to any registered adult
leader, Scout, Venturer, or Explorer who is age 15 or older.
The training must be conducted by a council-approved
instructor, takes roughly eight hours, and is valid for three
years. An Instructor Guide is available at: www.scouting.org/
filestore/Outdoor%20Program/Aquatics/pdf/430-501.pdf.
Adult and youth first aid training, including CPR, is an
important safety consideration for all Scouting activities,
not just boating. First aid training is not included in the
Paddle Craft Safety course with the expectation that the
leader has addressed that need separately, as noted in
