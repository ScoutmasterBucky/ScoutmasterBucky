# Boardsailing BSA

<div class="D(f) Fxd(c)--s"><div>

Boardsailing BSA helps introduce basic boardsailing skills, equipment, and safety precautions; to encourage the development of skills that promote fitness and safe aquatic recreation; and to lay a foundation for more advanced and demanding boardsailing activities. It serves as a year-round program opportunity for Boy Scout and Venturing units and is well-suited for older Scouts at summer camp.

Any person recognized as a boardsailing instructor by the U.S. Windsurfing or U.S. Sailing associations may serve as a counselor for this award with the approval of the local council. Adults with similar qualifications may serve as counselors with approval from a council aquatics committee. A person trained and experienced in boardsailing skills and safety may provide instruction for this award in a Scout summer camp program under the supervision of a currently trained BSA Aquatics Instructor. All requirements must be completed as stated

Instruction must be conducted on a protected body of water in an area free from other traffic or large waves. Initial water entry and practice should be on a gradual beach clear of hazards. A steady three- to seven-knot breeze is ideal for beginner practice. All participants should be close enough to supervisory personnel for efficient instruction and ready assistance.

Note: Swim trunks emblem—The Boardsailing BSA patch is NOT worn on the uniform; it is worn on the left side of the swim trunks
