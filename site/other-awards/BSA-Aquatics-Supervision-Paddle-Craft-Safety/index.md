# BSA Aquatics Supervision Paddle Craft Safety

<div class="D(f) Fxd(c)--s"><div>

Float trips are popular Boy Scout, Venturing, and Sea Scout activities. Safety Afloat awareness training provides guidelines for safe float trips and is required of unit leaders, but does not provide the skill training mandated by those guidelines. BSA Paddle Craft Safety expands Safety Afloat training to include the skills, as well as the knowledge, needed for a unit leader to confidently supervise canoeing or kayaking excursions.

The program contains four separate modules. Basic Canoeing and Basic Kayaking options cover flat water skills. River Canoeing and River Kayaking options build on the basic programs to include moving water.

Persons completing the training should be better prepared to supervise paddle craft activities. The training is open to any registered adult leader, Scout, Venturer, Sea Scout, or Explorer who is age 15 or older. The training must be conducted by a council approved instructor and is valid for three years.

## BSA Aquatics Supervision Paddle Craft Safety Requirements

Upon successful completion of any, or all, of the 4 course modules within the Paddle Craft Safety training, participants earn the Paddle Craft Safety Patch and the respective discipline segment patch(es) along with their certification card, good for three years.  The patches were not specifically designed for wear, hence you will not find display guidelines in the BSA Insignia Guide for these.  As such, for those that feel the need to wear these patches, they may be combined and worn as a single temporary patch.

The important item is the Paddle Craft Safety Pocket Certificate signed by your instructor and to have the certificate on your person whenever performing aquatic supervision activities.
