The Cyber Chip for Scouts BSA comes in two different levels, depending on the Scout's grade.

Note: All Cyber Chips will expire annually. Each Scout will need to go to [Netsmartz](https://www.missingkids.org/NetSmartz) and complete 2 new resources to recommit to net safety and netiquette. Then, with the unit leader, the Scout can add the new date to the Cyber Chip card or certificate.
