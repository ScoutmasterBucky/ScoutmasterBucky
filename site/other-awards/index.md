# Other Scout Awards

Beyond rank and merit badges, there are a number of other fun and interesting awards a Scout may earn. Some are quite easy, relative to merit badges and rank advancement, while others are extraordinarily difficult and time consuming.

Shown here are some of these additional awards and recognitions a Scout may earn. Some of these are taken from the **2020 Scouts BSA Requirements** book, and are noted accordingly. Others are from National BSA communications and documentation.
