Since 1910, conservation has been an integral part of the program of the Boy Scouts of America. The BSA has been a positive force in conservation and environmental efforts. Scouts have rendered distinguished public service by helping to conserve wildlife, energy, forests, soil, and water. Past generations of Scouts have been widely recognized for undertaking conservation Good Turn action projects in their local communities.

Scouts of today have grown up hearing words such as ecosystem, biodiversity, and climate change. They recognize the need for, and the benefits of, conserving natural resources. Scouts understand that we all must work together for the betterment of the land, forests, wildlife, air, and water.

The Conservation Good Turn award is to encourage packs, troops, crews, and ships to join with conservation or environmental organization (federal, state, local or private) to carry out a Conservation Good Turn in their home communities.

## Conservation Good Turn Requirements

The Conservation Good Turn Award is an opportunity for Cub Scout packs, Scouts BSA troops, Venturing crews, or Sea Scout ships to join with conservation or environmental organizations (federal, state, local, or private) to carry out a conservation Good Turn in their home communities.

    - The Scouting unit contacts a conservation agency and offers to carry out a Good Turn project.
    - The agency identifies a worthwhile and needed project that the unit can accomplish.
    - Working together in the local community, the unit and the agency plan the details and establish the date, time, and location for carrying out the project.

*Scouts participating in the Conservation Good Turn can meet certain rank and merit badge requirements. Troops, crews and ships should consider advancement requirements when selecting projects to carry out.*

Recognitions items include a certificate for the unit and a patch for participating youth and adult members.
